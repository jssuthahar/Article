# Python Setup in Visual Studio Code

This guide is written for **beginners** who are new to computers and programming.  
It explains Python setup in **very simple words** with **full forms**.

---

## üñ• What is Python?

- **Python** = A programming language used to write programs.  
- It is popular because it is **easy to learn** and is used in **websites, apps, games, artificial intelligence, and data science**.

---

## üì¶ What is pip?

- **pip** = **‚ÄúPip Installs Packages‚Äù**  
- It is a **tool** that comes with Python.  
- It helps us install **extra libraries** (ready-made code written by others).

üëâ Example:  
```bash
pip install numpy
````

This command installs the **NumPy** library for mathematics.

Think of **pip as an App Store for Python**.

---

## üîç What is Python Interpreter?

* **Interpreter** = A program that **reads Python code and runs it** line by line.
* Without an interpreter, the computer cannot understand Python.

üëâ Example:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Here, the **Python Interpreter** tells the computer how to show **Hello World**.

## üéØ Why do we need ‚ÄúPython: Select Interpreter‚Äù in VS Code?

In **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:

* You may have many Python versions (e.g., Python 3.9, Python 3.11).
* Different projects may use different versions.
* Some projects use **virtual environments** (explained later).

So, you must tell VS Code:
üëâ **‚ÄúWhich Python should be used for this project?‚Äù**

That is why we select **Python: Select Interpreter**.

If you don‚Äôt select correctly:

* The wrong Python version may run.
* Installed libraries may not be found.
* Errors may happen.

## üõ† Steps to Setup Python in Visual Studio Code

### 1. Install Python

1. Download from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. During installation:

   * ‚úÖ Select **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù**
   * ‚úÖ Ensure **pip** is installed

Check installation:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

---

### 2. Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download from: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install and open it.

---

### 3. Install Python Extension in VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to **Extensions** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search **Python (by Microsoft)**.
4. Click **Install**.

---

### 4. Select Python Interpreter

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
2. Type: **Python: Select Interpreter**.
3. Choose your installed Python version (example: `Python 3.11`).

---

### 5. Run Your First Program

1. Create a new file: `hello.py`
2. Add code:

   ```python
   print("Hello, Python in VS Code!")
   ```
3. Run it:

   * Right-click ‚Üí **Run Python File in Terminal**
   * OR press `Ctrl+F5`

## ‚úÖ Summary for Students

* **Python** = A programming language.
* **pip** = Pip Installs Packages ‚Üí installs extra tools/libraries.
* **Interpreter** = The program that runs Python code.
* **Select Interpreter** = Tell VS Code which Python to use.
