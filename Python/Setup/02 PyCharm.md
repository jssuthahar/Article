## üñ• What is Python?

- **Python** = A programming language used to write programs.  
- It is popular because it is **easy to learn** and used in **websites, apps, games, artificial intelligence, and data science**.

---

## üì¶ What is pip?

- **pip** = **‚ÄúPip Installs Packages‚Äù**  
- It is a **tool** that comes with Python.  
- It helps us install **extra libraries** (ready-made code written by others).

üëâ Example:  
```bash
pip install numpy
````

This installs the **NumPy** library for mathematics.

Think of **pip as an App Store for Python**.

---

## üîç What is Python Interpreter?

* **Interpreter** = A program that **reads Python code and runs it** line by line.
* Without an interpreter, the computer cannot understand Python.

üëâ Example:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Here, the **Python Interpreter** tells the computer how to display **Hello World**.
