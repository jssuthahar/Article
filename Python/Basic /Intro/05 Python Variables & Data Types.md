# üêç Python Variables & Data Types

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Variable?

A **variable** is like a *box* that stores a value.
You give the box a **name** (variable name), and you can change or reuse it later.

Example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name, age)
```

Output:

```
Alice 25
```

Here, `name` and `age` are variables.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Python Variables Don‚Äôt Need a Data Type

In many languages (like **C, C++, Java, C#**), you must **declare the data type** before using a variable:

```java
int age = 25;     // Java
string name = "Alice"; 
```

But in **Python**, you just assign the value:

```python
age = 25          # Python automatically knows this is an integer
name = "Alice"    # Python automatically knows this is a string
```

‚úÖ **Why?**

* Python is **dynamically typed** ‚Üí It decides the variable‚Äôs type at *runtime* (when the program runs).
* Java, C# are **statically typed** ‚Üí You must define type before running.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Beginner‚Äôs View

Think of Python like a smart teacher.
If you write:

```python
x = 10
```

Python says: ‚ÄúOh, `x` is a number (int).‚Äù

If you write:

```python
x = "Hello"
```

Python says: ‚ÄúNow `x` is a string.‚Äù

You don‚Äôt need to tell Python the type ‚Äî it figures it out.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Intermediate View

Python uses something called **Duck Typing**:

> *‚ÄúIf it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it‚Äôs a duck.‚Äù*

Meaning ‚Üí Python doesn‚Äôt care about the type‚Äôs name. It only cares about what the object **can do**.

Example:

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]        # list
y = (1, 2, 3)        # tuple

print(len(x))        # Works ‚Üí list has length
print(len(y))        # Works ‚Üí tuple has length
```

Even though `list` and `tuple` are different types, Python treats them similarly when possible.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Expert View

* **Memory Management**: Python variables are *references* (pointers) to objects stored in memory.

* **Mutability**:

  * Immutable types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple` ‚Üí Once created, cannot change.
  * Mutable types: `list`, `dict`, `set` ‚Üí Can be modified.

* **Comparison with Java/C#:**

  * Java:

    ```java
    int num = 10;   // Fixed type (int)
    num = "Hello";  // ‚ùå Compile-time error
    ```
  * Python:

    ```python
    num = 10
    num = "Hello"   # ‚úÖ Allowed (but may cause confusion if not careful)
    ```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Type Checking in Python

You can always check the type with `type()`:

```python
x = 100
print(type(x))   # <class 'int'>

y = "Python"
print(type(y))   # <class 'str'>
```

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Type Conversion (Casting)

Convert variables from one type to another:

```python
x = "100"
y = int(x) + 50
print(y)   # 150
```

Common conversions:

* `int()` ‚Üí to integer
* `float()` ‚Üí to decimal
* `str()` ‚Üí to string
* `bool()` ‚Üí to True/False

## üåü Pro Tips

* ‚úÖ Use **descriptive names**: `customer_age` is better than `x`.
* ‚úÖ Keep variable usage **consistent**. Don‚Äôt change type unless needed.
* ‚úÖ For big projects, use **type hints** (introduced in Python 3.5+):

```python
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 25
height: float = 5.6
```

This doesn‚Äôt force types (still dynamic), but helps other developers and tools (like editors/linters).

* ‚úÖ Remember: **Readability > Cleverness**.
  Python is designed for clarity ‚Äî follow that principle.

## üìù Task Assignments

Try these exercises:

1. Create variables `name`, `age`, `city` and print them in one sentence.
   Example: `"My name is Alice, I am 25, I live in London."`

2. Store `"100"` as a string. Convert it into an integer and add 20.

3. Create a variable `price = 99.99`. Convert it to an integer.

4. Use `type()` to check:

   * `42`
   * `3.14`
   * `"Hello"`
   * `True`

5. Try reassigning a variable:

   ```python
   x = 10
   x = "Python"
   print(x)
   ```
