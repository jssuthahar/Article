## üìò Beginner Level Questions

### 1. What is an abstract class in C#?
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. It can contain both abstract methods (without body) and regular methods (with body). It serves as a base class for other classes.

```csharp
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound();
    public void Sleep() => Console.WriteLine("Sleeping...");
}
```

### 2. What is an interface in C#?
An interface is a contract that defines method signatures without implementation. Classes and structs implement interfaces.

```csharp
interface IAnimal
{
    void MakeSound();
}
```

### 3. Can a class implement multiple interfaces?
Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces in C#. This enables multiple inheritance of type.

### 4. Can an interface contain method implementation?
No, interfaces could not have implementations before C# 8.0. From C# 8.0 onward, default implementations are allowed.

### 5. What is the purpose of abstract classes and interfaces?
- Abstract classes are used when there is a base functionality to share.
- Interfaces are used to define a contract or capability that multiple classes can implement.

### 6. Can you instantiate an abstract class?
No, you cannot create an object of an abstract class.

### 7. Can interfaces have fields?
No, interfaces cannot contain fields.

### 8. Can abstract classes have constructors?
Yes, abstract classes can have constructors, which are called when a derived class is instantiated.

## üéì Expert Level Questions

### 1. What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces?

| Feature               | Abstract Class        | Interface               |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Inheritance          | Single                | Multiple                |
| Implementation       | Allowed               | Only from C# 8.0 onward |
| Fields               | Yes                   | No                      |
| Constructors         | Yes                   | No                      |
| Access Modifiers     | Yes                   | Public only             |

### 2. When should you use an abstract class over an interface?
- Use an abstract class when you want to provide common functionality and base behavior.
- Use an interface when you want to define a contract that multiple unrelated classes can implement.

### 3. Can an abstract class implement an interface?
Yes, and it can either provide the implementation or leave it for derived classes.

### 4. How does C# support multiple inheritance using interfaces?
C# does not allow multiple class inheritance, but multiple interfaces can be implemented by a single class, providing a form of multiple inheritance.

### 5. What is the diamond problem and how does C# avoid it?
The diamond problem occurs in multiple inheritance when two base classes implement the same method. C# avoids this by not allowing multiple class inheritance, and interfaces do not carry implementation (until C# 8.0).

### 6. What happens if a class doesn't implement all interface members?
It must be declared as `abstract`; otherwise, the compiler throws an error.

### 7. Can you define private or protected members in interfaces?
No, interfaces members are public by default and cannot be private or protected.

### 8. Can an interface inherit another interface?
Yes, interfaces can inherit from one or more interfaces.

```csharp
interface IAnimal {
    void MakeSound();
}

interface IMammal : IAnimal {
    void Walk();
}
```

### 9. How does C# 8.0 enhance interfaces?
It allows:

#### a. Default method implementations
Interfaces can now include methods with default implementations. This allows developers to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

```csharp
interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
    void LogError(string message) => Console.WriteLine($"Error: {message}");
}
```

#### b. Static members (from C# 11)
Interfaces can declare static methods, properties, and fields. This enables defining utility logic directly within the interface itself.

```csharp
interface ICalculator
{
    static int DefaultValue => 10;
    static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
}
```

#### c. Private methods in interfaces
Private methods help organize and reuse code inside the interface itself. These methods are not accessible to implementing classes.

```csharp
interface IUtility
{
    void PublicMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Calling helper");
        Helper();
    }

    private void Helper()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a private helper method");
    }
}
```

These features improve flexibility, backward compatibility, and code reuse in interface-based designs.

### 10. Can abstract classes contain static methods?
Yes, abstract classes can have static methods.
