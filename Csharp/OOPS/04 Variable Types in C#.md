# Variable Types in C#

## 1. Normal `int` Variable
A normal `int` variable is a standard integer type that can be modified at runtime.

### Real-time Example:
Imagine a shopping cart where the number of items is updated when a user adds or removes products.

```csharp
int itemCount = 0;
itemCount++; // User adds an item
Console.WriteLine(itemCount); // Output: 1
itemCount--; // User removes an item
Console.WriteLine(itemCount); // Output: 0
```
- Stored in stack (for local variables).
- Can be modified anytime within the scope.

---

## 2. `const` Variable
A `const` variable is a compile-time constant. It cannot be modified after declaration.

### Real-time Example:
A tax percentage in an e-commerce application that never changes.

```csharp
class TaxInfo
{
    public const double TaxRate = 0.07; // 7% tax
}

Console.WriteLine("Tax Rate: " + TaxInfo.TaxRate); // Output: Tax Rate: 0.07
```
- Must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
- Stored in the programâ€™s metadata and replaced at compile-time.
- Cannot be modified at runtime.
- Only supports primitive types and strings.

---

## 3. `readonly` Variable
A `readonly` variable is initialized at the time of declaration or inside the constructor.

### Real-time Example:
A database connection string that is set at runtime when the application starts.

```csharp
class Config
{
    public readonly string ConnectionString;
    
    public Config(string connectionString)
    {
        ConnectionString = connectionString;
    }
}

Config config = new Config("Server=MyDB;Database=Test;");
Console.WriteLine(config.ConnectionString); // Output: Server=MyDB;Database=Test;
```
- Can be assigned only in the declaration or constructor.
- Cannot be modified after object creation.
- Used when a value is known only at runtime.

---

## 4. `volatile` Variable
A `volatile` variable ensures that the value is always read from memory and not cached by the CPU, making it thread-safe for certain operations.

### Real-time Example:
A flag that indicates whether a background file download is complete.

```csharp
class DownloadManager
{
    public volatile bool isDownloading;
}

DownloadManager manager = new DownloadManager();
manager.isDownloading = true; // Download starts
Console.WriteLine(manager.isDownloading); // Output: true
```
- Used in multi-threading scenarios.
- Prevents compiler optimizations that may cache the variable.
- Only applicable to fields (not local variables).

---

## 5. `static` Variable
A `static` variable belongs to the class rather than instances of the class.

### Real-time Example:
A counter that keeps track of the number of users logged into a web application.

```csharp
class UserSession
{
    public static int ActiveUsers = 0;
    
    public UserSession()
    {
        ActiveUsers++;
    }
}

UserSession user1 = new UserSession();
UserSession user2 = new UserSession();
Console.WriteLine(UserSession.ActiveUsers); // Output: 2
```
- Shared across all instances of the class.
- Memory is allocated once in the static area.
- Can be accessed using the class name (`UserSession.ActiveUsers`).

# Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is the difference between `const` and `readonly`?
**Answer:**
- `const` is a compile-time constant, whereas `readonly` can be assigned at runtime (inside the constructor).
- `const` values are replaced at compile time, while `readonly` values remain as variables in memory.
- `const` cannot be changed once declared, but `readonly` can be assigned within the constructor.

### 2. Can a `readonly` variable be modified?
**Answer:**
Yes, but only inside the constructor of the class. Once assigned, it cannot be changed.

### 3. What is the purpose of the `volatile` keyword?
**Answer:**
The `volatile` keyword ensures that the latest value of a variable is always read from memory and not from CPU cache, which helps in multi-threaded environments.

### 4. Can we declare a `const` variable inside a class without initializing it?
**Answer:**
No, `const` variables must be initialized at the time of declaration.

### 5. What is the difference between `static` and `readonly` variables?
**Answer:**
- `static` belongs to the class and is shared among all instances.
- `readonly` is instance-specific but can only be assigned in the constructor.
- `static` variables exist for the lifetime of the application, whereas `readonly` variables are tied to object instances.

### 6. Can a `const` variable be `static`?
**Answer:**
No, because `const` variables are implicitly `static`. They are resolved at compile-time and do not need a `static` keyword.

### 7. When should we use `readonly` instead of `const`?
**Answer:**
Use `readonly` when the value is determined at runtime, such as when fetching configuration settings from a file or database.
