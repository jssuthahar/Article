# Access Modifiers in C\#

Access modifiers in C# define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, properties, and other members in your code. They control where your code elements can be accessed from — whether from inside the same class, the same assembly, or from other assemblies.

## Overview of Access Modifiers

C# supports the following access modifiers:

| Modifier             | Description                                                                                  | Accessible From                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public`             | No restrictions. Accessible from anywhere.                                                   | Anywhere (any assembly or class)                           |
| `private`            | Accessible only within the containing class or struct.                                       | Only inside the containing class or struct                 |
| `protected`          | Accessible within the containing class and derived classes.                                  | Containing class and subclasses (even in other assemblies) |
| `internal`           | Accessible anywhere within the same assembly (project).                                      | Any code in the same assembly                              |
| `protected internal` | Accessible within the same assembly or derived classes in any assembly.                      | Same assembly OR subclasses in other assemblies            |
| `private protected`  | Accessible within the containing class or derived classes **only within the same assembly**. | Containing class or subclasses in the same assembly        |

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. `public`

* The `public` access modifier allows the class, method, or member to be accessible from **anywhere** — no restrictions.
* Commonly used for APIs or methods that must be available to other parts of the program or external code.

```csharp
public class PublicClass
{
    public int PublicValue = 10;
}
```

Any other class in any assembly can access `PublicClass` and its `PublicValue`.

---

### 2. `private`

* The `private` modifier restricts access to the **declaring class or struct only**.
* It is the most restrictive access level.
* Useful for encapsulating data and implementation details.

```csharp
public class PrivateExample
{
    private int secretNumber = 42;

    private void SecretMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Secret");
    }
}
```

`secretNumber` and `SecretMethod` cannot be accessed outside the `PrivateExample` class.

---

### 3. `protected`

* The `protected` modifier allows access within the **containing class** and any **derived classes** (inheritance).
* Useful for allowing subclasses to access or modify base class members.

```csharp
public class BaseClass
{
    protected int protectedValue = 100;
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public void ShowValue()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(protectedValue); // Accessible here
    }
}
```

---

### 4. `internal`

* The `internal` modifier restricts access to **any code within the same assembly** (DLL or EXE).
* It cannot be accessed from another assembly.
* Ideal for project-internal implementation details you don’t want exposed publicly.

```csharp
internal class InternalClass
{
    internal void InternalMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Internal");
    }
}
```

Classes and members marked `internal` can be accessed by any code in the same compiled assembly but **not outside it**.

---

### 5. `protected internal`

* Combines `protected` OR `internal` accessibility.
* Accessible either from derived classes OR from any code in the same assembly.

```csharp
public class ProtectedInternalClass
{
    protected internal int value = 500;
}
```

This means:

* If you are in the same assembly, you can access `value`.
* If you are in a derived class (even in a different assembly), you can access `value`.

---

### 6. `private protected` (C# 7.2+)

* Restricts access to derived classes **within the same assembly only**.
* More restrictive than `protected internal`.

```csharp
public class PrivateProtectedClass
{
    private protected int number = 123;
}

public class DerivedClass : PrivateProtectedClass
{
    public void ShowNumber()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(number); // Accessible here if in same assembly
    }
}
```

Derived classes outside the assembly cannot access `number`.

| `protected internal` | Yes        | Yes                           | Yes                            | Yes           | No             |
| `private protected`  | Yes        | Yes                           | No                             | Yes           | No             |

## Example Putting It All Together

```csharp
public class AccessDemo
{
    public int PublicField = 1;
    private int PrivateField = 2;
    protected int ProtectedField = 3;
    internal int InternalField = 4;
    protected internal int ProtectedInternalField = 5;
    private protected int PrivateProtectedField = 6;

    public void ShowAll()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Public: {PublicField}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Private: {PrivateField}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Protected: {ProtectedField}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Internal: {InternalField}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Protected Internal: {ProtectedInternalField}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Private Protected: {PrivateProtectedField}");
    }
}
```

## When to Use Which Access Modifier?

* Use `private` to hide implementation details.
* Use `public` for API or things that must be visible everywhere.
* Use `protected` to allow inheritance with some controlled exposure.
* Use `internal` to restrict access to the same project/assembly.
* Use `protected internal` to combine the benefits of `protected` and `internal`.
* Use `private protected` when you want derived class access but only inside the same assembly.
