# üìò Abstract Class in C#

## üîç What is an Abstract Class?
An **abstract class** is a special type of class in C# that **cannot be instantiated directly**. It is meant to serve as a **base class** for other classes and can contain both:
- **Abstract methods** (methods without implementation),
- **Concrete methods** (methods with implementation).

It acts as a **blueprint** for derived classes.

```csharp
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound(); // Abstract method (no body)
    
    public void Sleep()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sleeping...");
    }
}
```

## ‚ùì Why Use an Abstract Class?
Use an abstract class when:
- You want to provide **partial implementation** to child classes.
- You want to enforce a certain structure (like abstract methods) but also share common logic (via concrete methods).
- You have a base class that should not be instantiated on its own.

üí° Think of it as a base template with shared functionality and some rules.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use an Abstract Class

To use an abstract class:
- Inherit it using `:` symbol.
- Provide implementation for all abstract methods in the derived class.

```csharp
class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
    }
}
```

```csharp
Dog myDog = new Dog();
myDog.MakeSound(); // Output: Woof!
myDog.Sleep();     // Output: Sleeping...
```

## üîÑ Abstract Class vs Interface

| Feature                   | Abstract Class                      | Interface                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Inheritance               | Single inheritance only              | Multiple inheritance possible      |
| Method Implementation     | Can have both abstract & concrete methods | Only declarations (until C# 8+) |
| Constructor               | Can have constructors                | Cannot have constructors           |
| Access Modifiers          | Supports access modifiers            | Methods are public by default      |
| Fields/Properties         | Can have fields, properties, etc.    | Only properties (no fields)        |
| Use Case                  | Shared code with optional overrides  | Pure abstraction, capabilities     |

## ‚úÖ When to Use What?

| Scenario                                      | Use Abstract Class | Use Interface     |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| You need default behavior (shared logic)      | ‚úÖ                  | ‚ùå                |
| You need to define a capability (like `IDisposable`) | ‚ùå            | ‚úÖ                |
| You need multiple inheritance                 | ‚ùå                  | ‚úÖ                |
| You want to enforce structure + logic         | ‚úÖ                  | ‚ùå                |

## üìå Summary
- **Abstract class** = base class with shared logic + rules.
- **Interface** = contract with no implementation.
- Use abstract class when you need a common base and partial implementation.
- Use interface when you're just defining behavior to be implemented.
