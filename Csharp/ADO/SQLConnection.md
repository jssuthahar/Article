# ADO.NET and Connection Strings in C\#

## Overview

**ADO.NET** (ActiveX Data Objects for .NET) is a set of classes that expose data access services for .NET Framework programmers. It is used to connect to databases, execute commands, and retrieve results.

This document demonstrates how to build a connection string dynamically using user input and open a connection to a SQL Server database using `SqlConnection`.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Connection String**

A connection string provides the necessary information to establish a connection with a data source. This includes:

* Server name
* Database name
* Authentication details (Integrated Security or SQL login)
* Additional settings like encryption

### 2. **SqlConnection**

This is the primary ADO.NET class used to establish a connection with a SQL Server database.

---

## Example: Dynamic Connection String in C\#

```csharp
// Read values from input fields (typically TextBoxes in a WinForms app)
string conn = $"Data Source={txtserver.Text};Initial Catalog={txtDatbase.Text};Integrated Security=True;Encrypt=false";

// Create a new SQL connection
SqlConnection sqlConnection = new SqlConnection(conn);

// Open the connection
sqlConnection.Open();
```

### Explanation:

* `Data Source`: Specifies the name or network address of the instance of SQL Server.
* `Initial Catalog`: The name of the database.
* `Integrated Security=True`: Uses Windows Authentication.
* `Encrypt=false`: Disables encryption of the connection.

---

## Best Practices

* Use `using(SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(...))` to auto-dispose the connection.
* Avoid hard-coding sensitive data like passwords in connection strings.
* Prefer Windows Authentication (`Integrated Security=True`) when possible.
* Store connection strings in `app.config` or `web.config` for reusability and security.

## Sample with Exception Handling

```csharp
try
{
    string conn = $"Data Source={txtserver.Text};Initial Catalog={txtDatbase.Text};Integrated Security=True;Encrypt=false";
    using (SqlConnection sqlConnection = new SqlConnection(conn))
    {
        sqlConnection.Open();
        MessageBox.Show("Connection successful!");
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    MessageBox.Show("Error: " + ex.Message);
}
```

## ADO.NET Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. **What is ADO.NET?**

**Answer:** ADO.NET is a data access technology from the .NET Framework that provides communication between relational and non-relational systems using a set of components like `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, `SqlDataReader`, etc.

---

### 2. **What is a connection string in ADO.NET?**

**Answer:** A connection string is a string that specifies information about a data source and the means of connecting to it, such as server name, database name, user credentials, and other parameters.

---

### 3. **What is the difference between `SqlConnection` and `OleDbConnection`?**

**Answer:**

* `SqlConnection` is used to connect to SQL Server.
* `OleDbConnection` is used to connect to other databases like MS Access or Excel using OLE DB provider.

---

### 4. **What are the main components of ADO.NET?**

**Answer:**

* `Connection`
* `Command`
* `DataReader`
* `DataAdapter`
* `DataSet`
* `DataTable`

---

### 5. **What is the purpose of `SqlDataReader`?**

**Answer:** `SqlDataReader` is used to read data from a database in a fast, forward-only, read-only manner.

---

### 6. **What is the use of `using` block in ADO.NET?**

**Answer:** It ensures that the connection object is disposed and closed properly even if an exception occurs, which helps prevent memory leaks.

---

### 7. **What does `Integrated Security=True` mean in a connection string?**

**Answer:** It means Windows Authentication will be used instead of SQL Server Authentication. The current Windows user's credentials are used to authenticate.

---

### 8. **What is the role of `SqlDataAdapter`?**

**Answer:** `SqlDataAdapter` acts as a bridge between a `DataSet` and a SQL Server database. It is used to retrieve and update data using commands.

---

### 9. **How do you handle database connection failures in ADO.NET?**

**Answer:** Use `try-catch` blocks around connection and command executions, and optionally log or display meaningful error messages.

---

### 10. **Where should you store your connection string in a .NET application?**

**Answer:** It is best practice to store it in `app.config` or `web.config` under the `<connectionStrings>` section for reusability and security.
