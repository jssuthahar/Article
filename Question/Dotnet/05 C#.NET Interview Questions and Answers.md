# üìò C#/.NET Interview Questions and Answers

This document provides essential technical interview questions and detailed answers for C# and .NET developers. Perfect for freshers and mid-level candidates preparing for interviews.


## üí° Technical Questions

### 1. What is OOPs?

OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. It organizes software design around data (objects), rather than functions and logic. The four core pillars are:

* **Encapsulation**
* **Abstraction**
* **Inheritance**
* **Polymorphism**

---

### 2. Difference Between Abstraction and Polymorphism

| Feature    | Abstraction                       | Polymorphism                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Definition | Hides internal implementation     | One interface, many implementations                          |
| Purpose    | Focus on "what" rather than "how" | Enables flexibility through method overriding or overloading |
| Example    | Abstract class/interface          | Virtual methods, method overloading                          |

### 3. What Are Value Types and Reference Types?

* **Value Types**: Stored in stack memory. e.g., `int`, `bool`, `char`, `struct`
* **Reference Types**: Stored in heap memory. e.g., `string`, `class`, `array`

---

### 4. Difference Between `async` and `await`

* `async`: Marks a method as asynchronous.
* `await`: Pauses method execution until the awaited task completes.

```csharp
public async Task<int> GetDataAsync() {
    var result = await GetFromDbAsync();
    return result;
}
```

---

### 5. What is .NET Core?

* .NET Core is a **cross-platform**, **open-source**, and **lightweight** version of the .NET Framework.
* Supports Linux, Windows, and macOS.
* High-performance and ideal for microservices and cloud apps.

---

### 6. What is ViewBag, ViewData, and TempData?

| Feature  | ViewBag                           | ViewData        | TempData                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Type     | Dynamic                           | Dictionary      | Dictionary                |
| Lifetime | Current request                   | Current request | Until read (next request) |
| Use Case | Pass data from controller to view |                 |                           |

---

### 7. What is Entity Framework?

Entity Framework (EF) is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that:

* Maps .NET classes to database tables.
* Eliminates most data-access code.
* Supports LINQ queries.

---

### 8. What is Stored Procedure?

* A precompiled SQL query stored in the database.
* Reduces SQL injection risk and improves performance.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployees
AS
BEGIN
   SELECT * FROM Employees
END
```

---

### 9. Difference Between `DELETE`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE`

| Operation | Description                   | Rollback | Removes Structure |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| DELETE    | Deletes rows (with condition) | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå                 |
| TRUNCATE  | Deletes all rows (faster)     | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå                 |
| DROP      | Removes table entirely        | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ                 |

---

### 10. Explain About `SELECT` Query

`SELECT` is used to fetch data from a table.

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

---

### 11. What Are Joins and Their Types?

Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

* **INNER JOIN** ‚Äì Matching data only
* **LEFT JOIN** ‚Äì All left table + matched right
* **RIGHT JOIN** ‚Äì All right table + matched left
* **FULL JOIN** ‚Äì All matching/non-matching records

---

### 12. `IN` and `BETWEEN` Query

* `IN`: Matches values from a list

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Products WHERE CategoryID IN (1, 3, 5);
  ```

* `BETWEEN`: Matches range

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
  ```

---

### 13. What is Dependency Injection?

A design pattern used to reduce tight coupling.
In .NET Core, services are injected into constructors:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;
    public HomeController(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
}
```

---

### 14. What is Subquery?

A subquery is a query nested inside another SQL query.

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE Name = 'HR');
```

---

### 15. Types of Constraints in SQL

* **PRIMARY KEY** ‚Äì Uniquely identifies rows
* **FOREIGN KEY** ‚Äì Links tables
* **NOT NULL** ‚Äì Disallows NULL
* **UNIQUE** ‚Äì Ensures all values are different
* **CHECK** ‚Äì Validates column data

---

### 16. What is an Index?

Indexes are used to speed up data retrieval from a table.
Think of it as a book index‚Äîfast lookups but slower inserts/updates.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);
```
