### 🔹 Common Tools:

* GitHub
* Azure DevOps
* GitLab

### 🔹 How It Works:

* One central repository
* Developers create branches
* Code is reviewed
* Merged into main branch

📌 This ensures:

* No code loss
* Version control
* Team collaboration

## 9️⃣ Daily Work in Agile Project (Simple)

1. Daily Stand-up Meeting
