## 🎤 “Tell Me About Yourself” 

Hi, my name is Karthikeyan. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering, and I’m currently working as a Full Stack Intern at MSDEVBUILD.

During my internship, I’ve worked on real-time projects using .NET Core, C#, SQL Server, and WPF for desktop applications. I’ve built APIs, implemented CRUD operations, and worked with frontend Razor Pages as well.

I also have practical experience with Microsoft Azure, where I’ve deployed applications using Azure Web App, connected to Azure SQL Database, and managed file uploads using Azure Blob Storage.

I’ve worked in an Agile environment, participated in daily stand-ups and sprint planning, and used tools like Azure DevOps and Git for version control.

As part of my internship, I’ve completed two major projects — one is an employee management system using .NET Core and SQL, and the other is a WPF desktop app that integrates with Azure Blob Storage to manage documents.

I’m a quick learner, passionate about full-stack development, and I enjoy solving problems through clean, maintainable code. I’m now looking for a full-time opportunity where I can apply my skills, contribute to real-world software, and continue learning from experienced developers.

Thank you for the opportunity!
