## ðŸ‘‹ Tell Me About Yourself (with Projects)

Hello, my name is **Nikhil**.

Iâ€™m a .NET Full Stack Developer with **6 months of internship experience**, during which I worked on multiple real-time applications using **C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL Server, WPF, Azure**, and **Entity Framework**.

I have hands-on experience building both **desktop** and **web applications**, and Iâ€™m comfortable working with frontend (like WPF and MAUI), backend (C#, Web API), and databases (SQL Server).

During my internship, I contributed to two major projects:

### ðŸ›’ 1. Online Shopping Application

* Built a full-stack shopping application where users can **register, browse products, add to cart, and place orders**.
* Developed **REST APIs** using ASP.NET Core, implemented **authentication using Identity**, and handled the **shopping cart and order placement logic**.
* Created an **admin panel** to manage product inventory.
* Frontend was developed using **Razor Pages and Bootstrap**, and backend used **Entity Framework with SQL Server**.

### ðŸ§¾ 2. Billing Management System (Desktop App)

* Developed a **WPF-based billing application** for local shops to **create invoices, manage customers and products, and generate daily sales reports**.
* Used **MVVM pattern** for clean code separation, and **Entity Framework** for data access.
* Added features like **tax/GST calculation** and **low stock alerts**.

These projects gave me practical experience in writing clean code, working with APIs, databases, and designing responsive UIs.

Iâ€™m now looking for a **.NET developer role** where I can continue growing and contribute to impactful applications.

## ðŸ§  If Asked: "Can You Explain One Project in Detail?"

Sure, Iâ€™ll explain the Online Shopping Application.

I worked on both frontend and backend. I created **RESTful APIs** using ASP.NET Core Web API for user registration, product listing, and order management.
On the frontend, I used **Razor Pages with Bootstrap** for the user and admin UI.

I also implemented **authentication** using ASP.NET Identity, and **Entity Framework Core** to manage product and order data in **SQL Server**.

One challenge was handling the **cart logic**, like merging items on login and checking stock quantity before placing an order â€” I handled this in the service layer.

The admin module allows adding/editing products, tracking orders, and managing inventory.

Overall, this project helped me understand full-stack development and how to build production-like applications from scratch.
