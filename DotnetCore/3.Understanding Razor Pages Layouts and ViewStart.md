# README: Understanding Razor Pages Layouts and ViewStart

## 1. Introduction

In ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, layouts and the `_ViewStart.cshtml` file help maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple pages. This document explains their roles, how to use multiple layouts, and common interview questions.

## 2. \_Layout.cshtml (Master Page)

### What is `_Layout.cshtml`?

The `_Layout.cshtml` file acts as a master page for Razor views, containing the common structure (e.g., header, navigation, footer). It helps maintain a consistent UI.

### Default Structure of `_Layout.cshtml`

```razor
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>MSDEVBUILD/title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/site.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <a href="/">Home</a> |
            <a href="/About">About</a>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        @RenderBody()
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; @DateTime.Now.Year - MyApp</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

- `@RenderBody()`: Placeholder for page-specific content.

## 3. \_ViewStart.cshtml (Global Layout Configuration)

### What is `_ViewStart.cshtml`?

The `_ViewStart.cshtml` file allows setting a common layout for all Razor views in a directory.

### Default Structure of `_ViewStart.cshtml`

```razor
@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
```

### How it Works:

- When a Razor Page loads, it first checks `_ViewStart.cshtml` for layout settings.
- If `_ViewStart.cshtml` is missing, Razor Pages will need to define layouts individually.

## 4. Using Multiple Layouts

Sometimes, you need different layouts for different pages. Here’s how to manage multiple layouts in Razor Pages.

### Option 1: Set Layout in `_ViewStart.cshtml` for a Specific Folder

If a subset of pages needs a different layout, place a `_ViewStart.cshtml` inside that folder.

```razor
@{
    Layout = "_AdminLayout";
}
```

### Option 2: Set Layout in Individual Pages

You can override the default layout in any Razor Page using:

```razor
@{
    Layout = "_CustomLayout";
}
```

### Option 3: Conditional Layout Selection in `_ViewStart.cshtml`

```razor
@{
    if (User.IsInRole("Admin"))
    {
        Layout = "_AdminLayout";
    }
    else
    {
        Layout = "_Layout";
    }
}
```
