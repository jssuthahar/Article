## API

| Feature         | API | Web Service |
|----------------|-----|-------------|
| **Definition** | A set of rules that allows applications to communicate | A type of API that uses HTTP/HTTPS for communication |
| **Data Exchange Format** | Supports JSON, XML, binary data, etc. | Usually XML (SOAP) or JSON (REST) |
| **Protocol Used** | Can use HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, FTP, or custom protocols | Uses HTTP or HTTPS only |
| **Types** | REST API, SOAP API, GraphQL API, etc. | Mainly SOAP and REST |
| **Dependency on Web** | Not necessarily web-based | Must be web-based |
| **Use Case** | Used for communication between different software modules | Used to expose web-based services over the internet |

## Which One to Use?

### ✅ Use a Web Service if:
- You specifically need a service over the internet.
- You are using SOAP or REST as communication protocols.

### ✅ Use an API if:
- You need broader communication beyond the web (e.g., system-to-system communication via local network).
- You want flexibility in choosing protocols (TCP, FTP, etc.).

## API Types
### 1. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**
- Uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Works with JSON and XML.
- Stateless architecture ensures scalability and simplicity.
- Used by most modern web services (e.g., Twitter API, GitHub API).

### 2. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**
- XML-based protocol.
- Provides strong security with WS-Security.
- Follows strict standards for structured communication.
- Commonly used in enterprise applications like banking and telecommunication systems.

### 3. **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**
- Allows invoking functions remotely using HTTP requests.
- Used for simpler and faster service communication.
- Example: JSON-RPC, XML-RPC.

### 4. **GraphQL**
- Query language for APIs.
- Allows fetching specific data with a single request.
- Flexible compared to REST.
- Example: `www.msdevbuild.com/student/20`.

### 5. **OData (Open Data Protocol)**
- Developed by Microsoft.
- Best for querying and filtering data.
- Supports standard CRUD operations over RESTful HTTP.

## API Categories
### 1. **Private API**
- Used internally within an organization.
- Not accessible to external users.
- Example: Internal APIs used for company data processing.

### 2. **Public API**
- Available for public use.
- Used for third-party integrations.
- Example: Google Maps API, OpenWeather API.

### 3. **Partner API**
- Shared with specific business partners.
- Requires authentication and agreements.
- Example: Payment gateway APIs provided to merchants.

### 4. **Composite API**
- Combines multiple APIs into a single request.
- Helps reduce performance issues by decreasing network calls.
- Example: A travel booking API that fetches flight, hotel, and car rental details in one request.

## Popular APIs
- **Google Maps API**
- **Weather API**
- **ChatGPT API**
- **Azure REST API**

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
APIs allow communication between different languages and platforms.
