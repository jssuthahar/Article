# ⚙️ Async and Await in C#

`async` and `await` are powerful features in modern programming (like C# or JavaScript) that allow non-blocking execution. This makes applications faster, more responsive, and scalable—especially when dealing with I/O operations like API calls or file access.

## 🆚 Synchronous vs Asynchronous

| Feature              | Synchronous                          | Asynchronous (`async/await`)               |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Execution            | Blocks until operation completes     | Frees up thread until awaited task completes |
| UI Behavior          | Freezes during long tasks            | Remains responsive                         |
| Performance          | Slower for I/O-heavy workloads       | Scales better with I/O                     |
| Code Style           | Simple but limited                   | Slightly complex, more capable             |

## 💡 Real-world Use Case

> **Scenario:** A desktop or mobile app fetches weather data from an API.

- In a **synchronous method**, the app freezes until the response returns.
- In an **asynchronous method**, the request happens in the background while the UI stays responsive.

---

## 🔴 Synchronous Example (C#)

```csharp
public string GetWeather()
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    // Blocking call — not recommended
    var result = client.GetStringAsync("https://api.weather.com/today").Result;
    return result;
}

// Usage
Console.WriteLine(GetWeather()); // Freezes until request completes
```

---

## ✅ Asynchronous Example (C# with async/await)

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetWeatherAsync()
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    var result = await client.GetStringAsync("https://api.weather.com/today"); // Non-blocking
    return result;
}

// Usage (in async context)
Console.WriteLine(await GetWeatherAsync()); // Responsive and scalable
```

---

## 🖥️ Real-Time UI Example: Windows Forms / WPF

### ❌ Without async/await – UI Freezes

```csharp
private void btnFetch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var data = GetWeather(); // UI thread is blocked
    lblResult.Text = data;
}
```

### ✅ With async/await – UI Responsive

```csharp
private async void btnFetch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var data = await GetWeatherAsync(); // UI remains responsive
    lblResult.Text = data;
}
```

## 📌 Key Benefits of async/await

- ✅ Keeps apps responsive (especially UI apps)
- ✅ Handles many I/O operations efficiently
- ✅ Prevents thread blocking and improves scalability
- ✅ Easy to read and write like synchronous code
