# Passing Multiple Models to a View in ASP.NET Core MVC

In ASP.NET Core MVC, sometimes you may need to pass multiple models to a single view. There are different ways to achieve this, each with its own pros and cons.

## 1. Using ViewBag or ViewData

### Example:

```csharp
public IActionResult Index()
{
    ViewBag.Employeedata = new Employee { Eid = 1, Ename = "Jana" };
    return View();
}
```

### Do:

- Use `ViewBag` or `ViewData` for small pieces of data that do not require strong typing.
- Suitable for passing temporary data.

### Don't:

- Avoid using `ViewBag` or `ViewData` for complex objects as it lacks compile-time checking.
- Not recommended for structured data transfer between controller and view.

---

## 2. Using Tuple

### Example:

```csharp
public IActionResult AboutUS()
{
    Student stud = new Student { Sid = 1, Sname = "Devisri", ProfilePicture = "devisri.jpeg", Age = 35, Description = "I am working in Accenture" };
    Employee emp = new Employee { Eid = 1, Ename = "Jana" };

    return View((stud, emp));
}
```

### Do:

- Use tuples for returning multiple objects when working with small sets of data.
- Allows quick and easy multiple model passing.

### Don't:

- Avoid using tuples for complex scenarios as they lack meaningful property names in the view.
- Not the best option when models have relationships.

---

## 3. Using a ViewModel (Recommended Approach)

### Example:

```csharp
public class DashboardViewModel
{
    public Student Student { get; set; }
    public Employee Employee { get; set; }
}

public IActionResult AboutUS()
{
    DashboardViewModel model = new DashboardViewModel
    {
        Student = new Student { Sid = 1, Sname = "Devisri", ProfilePicture = "devisri.jpeg", Age = 35, Description = "I am working in Accenture" },
        Employee = new Employee { Eid = 1, Ename = "Jana" }
    };
    return View(model);
}
```

### Do:

- Use a `ViewModel` to encapsulate multiple models in a strongly-typed structure.
- Allows easier maintenance and better separation of concerns.
- Recommended for passing multiple related objects to a view.

### Don't:

- Avoid mixing unrelated models inside a single ViewModel.

## Conclusion

| Approach         | Pros                                     | Cons                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ViewBag/ViewData | Quick and dynamic                        | No compile-time checking, not suitable for complex data |
| Tuple            | Simple for small data sets               | Less readable and maintainable for large applications   |
| ViewModel        | Strongly typed, structured, maintainable | Requires additional class definition                    |
                                   |

For best practices, prefer **ViewModels**  for complex applications. Avoid excessive reliance on `ViewBag` or `ViewData` unless necessary.
