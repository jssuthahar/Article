# Passing Multiple Models to a View in ASP.NET Core MVC

In ASP.NET Core MVC, sometimes you may need to pass multiple models to a single view. There are different ways to achieve this, each with its own pros and cons.

## 1. Using ViewBag or ViewData

### Example:

```csharp
public IActionResult Index()
{
    ViewBag.Employeedata = new Employee { Eid = 1, Ename = "Jana" };
    return View();
}
```

### Do:

- Use `ViewBag` or `ViewData` for small pieces of data that do not require strong typing.
- Suitable for passing temporary data.

### Don't:

- Avoid using `ViewBag` or `ViewData` for complex objects as it lacks compile-time checking.
- Not recommended for structured data transfer between controller and view.

---

## 2. Using Tuple

### Example:

```csharp
public IActionResult AboutUS()
{
    Student stud = new Student { Sid = 1, Sname = "Devisri", ProfilePicture = "devisri.jpeg", Age = 35, Description = "I am working in Accenture" };
    Employee emp = new Employee { Eid = 1, Ename = "Jana" };

    return View((stud, emp));
}
```

### Do:

- Use tuples for returning multiple objects when working with small sets of data.
- Allows quick and easy multiple model passing.

### Don't:

- Avoid using tuples for complex scenarios as they lack meaningful property names in the view.
- Not the best option when models have relationships.

---

## 3. Using a ViewModel (Recommended Approach)

### Example:

```csharp
public class DashboardViewModel
{
    public Student Student { get; set; }
    public Employee Employee { get; set; }
}

public IActionResult AboutUS()
{
    DashboardViewModel model = new DashboardViewModel
    {
        Student = new Student { Sid = 1, Sname = "Devisri", ProfilePicture = "devisri.jpeg", Age = 35, Description = "I am working in Accenture" },
        Employee = new Employee { Eid = 1, Ename = "Jana" }
    };
    return View(model);
}
```

### Do:

- Use a `ViewModel` to encapsulate multiple models in a strongly-typed structure.
- Allows easier maintenance and better separation of concerns.
- Recommended for passing multiple related objects to a view.

### Don't:

- Avoid mixing unrelated models inside a single ViewModel.

## Conclusion

| Approach         | Pros                                     | Cons                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ViewBag/ViewData | Quick and dynamic                        | No compile-time checking, not suitable for complex data |
| Tuple            | Simple for small data sets               | Less readable and maintainable for large applications   |
| ViewModel        | Strongly typed, structured, maintainable | Requires additional class definition                    |
                                   |

For best practices, prefer **ViewModels**  for complex applications. Avoid excessive reliance on `ViewBag` or `ViewData` unless necessary.

Approch 1. ‚úÖ Using **Tuples** in Razor Views (read-only)
Approch 2. ‚úÖ Using **ViewModel classes** (recommended for forms and maintainability)

## ‚úÖ Approach 1: Using Tuple (Read-Only)

### üîπ When to Use:
Use this for **display-only** views where you want to return multiple objects without creating a separate view model class.

### üîπ Controller Example:

```csharp
public IActionResult AboutUS()
{
    Student stud = new Student 
    { 
        Sid = 1, 
        Sname = "Devisri", 
        ProfilePicture = "devisri.jpeg", 
        Age = 35, 
        Description = "I am working in Accenture" 
    };

    Employee emp = new Employee 
    { 
        Eid = 1, 
        Ename = "Jana" 
    };

    return View((stud, emp));
}
````

### üîπ Razor View (`AboutUS.cshtml`):

```csharp
@model (YourNamespace.Models.Student stud, YourNamespace.Models.Employee emp)

<h2>Student Details</h2>
<p>Name: @Model.stud.Sname</p>
<p>Age: @Model.stud.Age</p>
<p>Description: @Model.stud.Description</p>

<h2>Employee Details</h2>
<p>Name: @Model.emp.Ename</p>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This method is **not suitable** for form submissions or model binding in POST actions.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach 2: Using ViewModel Class (Recommended)

### üîπ When to Use:

Use this for **complex views**, especially when submitting forms or following best practices for separation of concerns.

### üîπ ViewModel Class:

```csharp
public class AboutUsViewModel
{
    public Student Student { get; set; }
    public Employee Employee { get; set; }
}
```

### üîπ Controller:

```csharp
public IActionResult AboutUS()
{
    var vm = new AboutUsViewModel
    {
        Student = new Student 
        { 
            Sid = 1, 
            Sname = "Devisri", 
            ProfilePicture = "devisri.jpeg", 
            Age = 35, 
            Description = "I am working in Accenture" 
        },
        Employee = new Employee 
        { 
            Eid = 1, 
            Ename = "Jana" 
        }
    };

    return View(vm);
}
```

### üîπ Razor View (`AboutUS.cshtml`):

```csharp
@model YourNamespace.Models.AboutUsViewModel

<h2>Student Details</h2>
<p>Name: @Model.Student.Sname</p>
<p>Age: @Model.Student.Age</p>
<p>Description: @Model.Student.Description</p>

<h2>Employee Details</h2>
<p>Name: @Model.Employee.Ename</p>
```

### üîπ Advantages of ViewModel:

* Strong typing
* Easily reusable
* Better support for form submission
* Clearer separation of data

## üìù Conclusion

| Feature         | Tuple           | ViewModel         |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Read-only views | ‚úÖ Good          | ‚úÖ Good            |
| Form submission | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ Fully supported |
| Reusability     | ‚ùå Hard to reuse | ‚úÖ Easy            |
| Maintainability | ‚ùå Poor          | ‚úÖ Best practice   |

**Recommendation**: Use ViewModel for production apps. Tuples are OK for quick demos or small read-only views.
