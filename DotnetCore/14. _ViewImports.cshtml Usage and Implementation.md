# _ViewImports.cshtml Usage and Implementation

## Overview
The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file in an ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Pages application is used to define common directives that apply to multiple Razor views. This helps reduce redundancy and improves maintainability.

## Usage
The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file allows you to:
- Import namespaces
- Add tag helpers
- Apply common settings across Razor views

## Implementation
### Creating `_ViewImports.cshtml`
Place the `_ViewImports.cshtml` file in the `Views` or `Pages` folder of your ASP.NET Core application.

### Sample Code
```razor
@using System
@using MyApp.Models
@using MyApp.Helpers

@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
@addTagHelper *, MyApp
```

### Explanation
- `@using` statements import namespaces, so you don't have to include them in every Razor view.
- `@addTagHelper` registers tag helpers globally in all views, eliminating the need to add them individually.

### Example Usage in a Razor View
Consider a Razor view (`Index.cshtml`) that uses the imported namespaces and tag helpers:

```razor
@model MyApp.Models.User

<h1>Welcome, @Model.Name!</h1>
<input asp-for="Email" />
```
Since `_ViewImports.cshtml` already includes `@using MyApp.Models`, there's no need to explicitly include it in `Index.cshtml`.

## Conclusion
Using `_ViewImports.cshtml` enhances code organization by reducing repetition and enforcing consistency across views in an ASP.NET Core application.
