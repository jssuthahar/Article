# .NET Core Routing

## What is Routing in .NET Core?
Routing in .NET Core is the process of mapping incoming HTTP requests to corresponding controller actions. It helps in defining how URLs should be structured and which logic should be executed when a request matches a given pattern.

## Enabling Routing in `Program.cs`
To enable routing in a .NET Core application, you need to configure the middleware pipeline properly in `Program.cs`. Here is how you can enable routing:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
});

app.Run();
```

### Example: Different Ways to Place Routing
1. **Using Attribute Routing:**
   
```csharp
[Route("msdevbuild/JSS")]
[Route("JS")]
[Route("msdevbuild")]
public IActionResult AboutUS()
{
    return View();
}
```

2. **Using Conventional Routing in `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "customRoute",
        pattern: "company/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
});
```

### 3. **Using Controller-Level Routing:**
You can also apply a route at the controller level to apply a base route to all actions within the controller.

```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class UserController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetUser(int id)
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

### Routing Parameters

#### Route Parameter Example
```csharp
[HttpGet("Home/User/{name}")]
public IActionResult UserDetails(int Sid, string name)
{
    return View();
}
```
- `{name}` is a route parameter captured from the URL.
- `Sid` is fetched using a query string.
- Example URL: `https://example.com/Home/User/John?Sid=1`

#### Query String Example
```csharp
public IActionResult UserInfo(int id, string category)
{
    return View();
}
```
- Example URL: `https://example.com/UserInfo?id=10&category=Admin`

#### Without `[FromQuery]` and `[FromRoute]`
```csharp
[HttpGet("Product/Details/{id}")]
public IActionResult ProductDetails(int id)
{
    return View();
}
```
- Example URL: `https://example.com/Product/Details/5`

## Advantages of Routing
- **Cleaner URLs**: Improves readability and usability.
- **SEO-friendly**: Helps in better indexing by search engines.
- **Flexibility**: Allows defining multiple routes for a single action.
- **Parameter Support**: Supports route parameters and query strings.
- **Maintainability**: Organizes application structure in a modular way.

## Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. What is routing in .NET Core?
**Answer**: Routing is the mechanism that maps incoming requests to appropriate controller actions based on defined URL patterns.

### 2. What are the types of routing in .NET Core?
**Answer**: There are two types:
   - **Conventional Routing**: Defined in `Program.cs`.
   - **Attribute Routing**: Defined directly on controllers/actions using attributes.

### 3. How can we define multiple routes for a single action?
**Answer**: By using multiple `[Route]` attributes above an action method.

### 4. What is the difference between `[FromRoute]` and `[FromQuery]`?
**Answer**: `[FromRoute]` extracts data from the URL path, whereas `[FromQuery]` extracts data from the query string.

### 5. How do you configure a default route in .NET Core?
**Answer**: Using the `MapControllerRoute` method in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
```

This ensures that if no specific route is matched, it defaults to `HomeController` and `Index` action.
