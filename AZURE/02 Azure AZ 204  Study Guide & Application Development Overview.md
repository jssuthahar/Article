## 1. Developing Azure Applications

You can develop applications on Azure using **different programming languages**, such as:

* Python
* C# / .NET
* Java
* Node.js / JavaScript

Once the application is developed, it can be deployed in different ways depending on the architecture and requirements.

## 2. Deploying Azure Applications

Azure provides multiple compute options for deploying applications:

| Deployment Type               | Description                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Virtual Machine (VM)**      | Full control over the OS, suitable for legacy or custom applications.                                  |
| **Web App (Managed Service)** | Platform as a Service (PaaS) to host web applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.  |
| **Container**                 | Deploy applications as Docker containers. Can be orchestrated with **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. |
| **Function (Serverless)**     | Event-driven, pay-per-use functions. Ideal for lightweight, task-based applications.                   |

## 3. Azure Storage & Databases

Azure offers a variety of storage and database solutions:

| Service                          | Use Case                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blob Storage**                 | Store unstructured data such as images, videos, and documents.             |
| **Azure Cosmos DB**              | Globally distributed NoSQL database.                                       |
| **Azure SQL Database**           | Fully managed relational SQL database.                                     |
| **SQL Database Managed Service** | Managed relational database with high availability, scaling, and security. |

## 4. Implementing Azure Security

Azure provides tools and services to secure applications and data:

| Service                | Purpose                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Azure Key Vault**    | Store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates securely.                          |
| **Microsoft Entra ID** | Identity and access management, authentication, and authorization for applications. |

**Category:** Implementing Azure Security

## 5. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

Monitoring ensures applications run smoothly and can be improved over time:

* **Monitor Application**: Azure Monitor, Application Insights
* **Improve Application Performance**: Storage caching, Redis, Content Delivery Network (CDN)
* **Troubleshooting**: Identify bottlenecks, optimize resources, and maintain high availability

**Category:** Monitoring & Troubleshooting Azure Applications

## 6. Connecting and Consuming Services

Azure allows integration between services and building event-driven architectures:

| Service                    | Use Case                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Management Service** | Create, publish, secure, and manage APIs.                  |
| **Event Grid**             | Build event-driven architectures using lightweight events. |
| **Event Hub**              | Ingest large-scale streaming data.                         |
| **Service Bus**            | Reliable message queuing for decoupled applications.       |

**Category:** Connecting & Consuming Azure Services

## Summary

When building applications in Azure:

1. **Develop** using any supported programming language.
2. **Deploy** using VM, Web App, Container, or Serverless Functions.
3. **Store Data** in Blob, SQL, or NoSQL databases.
4. **Secure** with Key Vault and Microsoft Entra ID.
5. **Monitor & Troubleshoot** using Azure Monitor, caching, and CDN.
6. **Connect Services** via API Management, Event Grid, Event Hub, or Service Bus.
