## üåê Public vs. Private IP Addresses

### üîì Public IP Address

* **Definition**: A Public IP address is a unique identifier assigned to your network by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). It allows devices on your network to communicate with devices on the internet.

* **Characteristics**:

  * **Uniqueness**: Each public IP address is unique across the entire internet.
  * **Accessibility**: Devices with public IPs can be accessed directly over the internet.
  * **Assignment**: Assigned by ISPs.
  * **Example**: `203.0.113.5`

* **Use Cases**:

  * Hosting websites or servers accessible over the internet.
  * Remote access to devices within a network.([Avira][1])

### üîí Private IP Address

* **Definition**: A Private IP address is assigned to devices within a private network, allowing them to communicate with each other. These addresses are not routable on the internet.

* **Characteristics**:

  * **Uniqueness**: Unique within the local network but can be reused in different private networks.
  * **Accessibility**: Not directly accessible from the internet.
  * **Assignment**: Assigned by network devices like routers using DHCP.
  * **Common Ranges**:

    * `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
    * `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
    * `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`
  * **Example**: `192.168.1.10`([Lifewire][2])

* **Use Cases**:

  * Connecting devices within a home or office network.
  * Assigning IPs to devices like printers, computers, and smartphones within a local network.([Avast][3])

## üìå Static vs. üîÑ Dynamic IP Addresses

### üìå Static IP Address

* **Definition**: A Static IP address is a fixed address manually assigned to a device, which does not change over time.([GeeksforGeeks][4])

* **Characteristics**:

  * **Consistency**: Remains the same unless manually changed.
  * **Assignment**: Manually configured by a network administrator or assigned by an ISP.
  * **Use Cases**:

    * Hosting servers (web, email, FTP).
    * Remote access to devices.
    * Network devices requiring consistent addressing.
  * **Example**: `192.168.1.100`

### üîÑ Dynamic IP Address

* **Definition**: A Dynamic IP address is automatically assigned to a device by a DHCP server and may change over time.

* **Characteristics**:

  * **Variability**: Can change each time the device connects to the network.
  * **Assignment**: Automatically assigned by DHCP servers.
  * **Use Cases**:

    * Home networks.
    * Devices that do not require a consistent IP address.
  * **Example**: `192.168.1.101` (assigned today), `192.168.1.102` (assigned tomorrow)

## üß† Real-World Examples

* **Public IP**: Your home router's IP address assigned by your ISP, allowing access to the internet.

* **Private IP**: Your laptop's IP address within your home network, such as `192.168.1.5`.

* **Static IP**: A web server hosting a website with a fixed IP address like `203.0.113.10`.

* **Dynamic IP**: A smartphone that receives a new IP address each time it connects to the Wi-Fi network.

## 1. IP Address Classes (A to E)

| IP Class | IP Range                    | Explanation                                                          |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class A  | 1.0.0.0 ‚Äì 126.255.255.255   | Used for very large networks. Supports millions of hosts.            |
| Class B  | 128.0.0.0 ‚Äì 191.255.255.255 | Used for medium-sized networks like universities or large companies. |
| Class C  | 192.0.0.0 ‚Äì 223.255.255.255 | Used for small networks like small businesses and home networks.     |
| Class D  | 224.0.0.0 ‚Äì 239.255.255.255 | Not for normal hosts. Used for multicast.                            |
| Class E  | 240.0.0.0 ‚Äì 255.255.255.255 | Reserved for experimental or research purposes.                      |

| Static IP  | Fixed IP that never changes           | Servers, CCTV, hosting            | ISP/Admin (manual) | ‚ùå No                           | 20.40.80.100 (public) or 192.168.1.50 (private) |
| Dynamic IP | Automatically assigned & can change   | Normal users/home Wi-Fi           | DHCP Server/ISP    | ‚úÖ Yes                          | 192.168.1.15 (private) or 103.20.55.60 (public) |

## 4. Key Points

* **Static IP** is fixed and predictable, ideal for servers.
* **Dynamic IP** is temporary and assigned automatically, ideal for general users.
* **Public IP** allows devices to be accessible over the internet.
* **Private IP** is used inside LAN for internal communication.
* **IP Classes** (A, B, C) determine the size of the network and host capacity.
