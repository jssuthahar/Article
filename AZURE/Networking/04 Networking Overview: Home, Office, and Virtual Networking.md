## üß© Why Do We Need a Virtual Network?

**Concept**: A Virtual Network (VNet) is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. It enables Azure resources like Virtual Machines (VMs) to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

**Diagram**:

```
+---------------------------+
|        Azure VNet         |
|  +---------+  +---------+ |
|  |  VM1    |  |  VM2    | |
|  +---------+  +---------+ |
+---------------------------+
```

*In this diagram, VM1 and VM2 are part of the same VNet, allowing them to communicate securely.*

## üåç Public IP Address

**Concept**: A Public IP address allows Azure resources to communicate with the internet. It's assigned to resources that need to be accessible from outside the Azure network.

**Diagram**:

```
Internet
   |
[Public IP]
   |
+---------+
|  Azure  |
|  VM     |
+---------+
```

*Here, the Azure VM has a Public IP, enabling internet communication.*

---

## üîí Private IP Address

**Concept**: A Private IP address is used for communication between Azure resources within the same VNet or connected VNets. These addresses are not routable from the internet.

**Diagram**:

```
+---------------------------+
|        Azure VNet         |
|  +---------+  +---------+ |
|  |  VM1    |<->|  VM2   | |
|  +---------+  +---------+ |
+---------------------------+
```

*VM1 and VM2 communicate using Private IPs within the VNet.*

## üóÇÔ∏è Subnetting

**Concept**: Subnetting divides a VNet into smaller segments, allowing for better organization and security.

**Diagram**:

```
+---------------------------------------+
|               Azure VNet              |
|  +-------------+  +----------------+  |
|  | Subnet A    |  |   Subnet B     |  |
|  | (Web Tier)  |  | (Database Tier)|  |
|  +-------------+  +----------------+  |
+---------------------------------------+
```

*Subnet A hosts web servers, while Subnet B hosts database servers, isolating them for security.*

## üîó Virtual Network Peering

**Concept**: VNet Peering connects two VNets, allowing resources in different VNets to communicate as if they were in the same network.

**Diagram**:

```
+----------------+       +----------------+
|    VNet A      |<----->|    VNet B      |
|  (10.0.0.0/16) |       |  (10.1.0.0/16) |
+----------------+       +----------------+
```

*Resources in VNet A can communicate with resources in VNet B through peering.*

## üîê Network Security Group (NSG)

**Concept**: NSGs contain security rules that allow or deny inbound and outbound network traffic to Azure resources.

**Diagram**:

```
+---------------------------+
|        Azure VNet         |
|  +---------+              |
|  |  VM     |              |
|  +----+----+              |
|       |                   |
|    [NSG Rules]            |
+---------------------------+
```

*NSG rules control the traffic flow to and from the VM.*

## üåâ VPN Gateway

**Concept**: A VPN Gateway connects your on-premises network to Azure through a secure VPN tunnel.

**Diagram**:

```
On-Premises Network
        |
     [VPN]
        |
+---------------------------+
|        Azure VNet         |
|  +---------+  +---------+ |
|  |  VM1    |  |  VM2    | |
|  +---------+  +---------+ |
+---------------------------+
```

*The on-premises network connects to Azure VNet via a VPN Gateway, enabling secure communication.*
