# üîí Secure Unique Default Hostname in Azure App Service

## üìò What is the "Secure Unique Default Hostname"?

Azure App Service assigns every web app a **default hostname** in the format:

```

https\://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net

````

The **"Secure Unique Default Hostname"** feature ensures that **only your app** can respond to requests made to this default hostname. This security setting **prevents hostname takeover attacks** where a malicious app could be deployed with your hostname if your app is deleted or moved.

---

## üß† Why is this Feature Important?

Imagine this scenario:

1. You create an app called `mydemoapp` in Azure App Service.
2. Azure assigns the default hostname:  
   `https://mydemoapp.azurewebsites.net`
3. Later, you delete the app or move it to a different region.
4. A malicious user creates a new app with the same name:  
   `mydemoapp.azurewebsites.net`
5. If users still have old links or bookmarks, they will unknowingly visit the **attacker‚Äôs app**.

### üîê The "Secure Unique Default Hostname" protects against this by:

- Tying your app's default hostname **uniquely to your subscription**.
- Preventing other Azure customers from using that hostname even if your app is deleted.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- üõ° **Prevents hostname hijacking**
- üîê **Secures legacy bookmarks and links**
- üóÇ **Ensures brand and identity continuity**
- üìâ **Reduces phishing and impersonation risks**

## üîß How to Enable It

This setting is **enabled by default** for new apps, but it's good to verify:

### ‚úÖ Azure Portal

1. Go to your App Service in the Azure Portal.
2. Navigate to:  
   **Settings > Custom domains > Advanced settings**
3. Look for the setting:  
   `Secure default hostname`
4. Ensure it is **enabled**.

### ‚úÖ Azure CLI

To check or enable:

```bash
az webapp update --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --set httpsOnly=true
````

> Note: The CLI does not expose a direct toggle for this feature yet, but `httpsOnly=true` is a best practice and part of the broader security configuration.

## ‚ùå What Happens If It‚Äôs Disabled?

* ‚ö†Ô∏è If your app is deleted, **someone else can register the same app name** and receive your old hostname.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Users visiting old links will be redirected to a potentially **malicious application**.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è You may be exposed to **phishing attacks** or **reputation damage**.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Search engines and crawlers** may still index the old hostname, pointing to the wrong app.

| Recommendation             | Why                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚úÖ Always enable HTTPS      | Encrypt traffic and avoid downgrade attacks            |
| ‚úÖ Use custom domains       | Helps branding and avoids relying on default hostnames |
| ‚úÖ Enable secure hostname   | Prevents re-use and impersonation                      |
| ‚úÖ Configure redirect rules | Redirect old links to your main domain                 |
| ‚úÖ Use deployment slots     | Avoid deleting and recreating apps unnecessarily       |
