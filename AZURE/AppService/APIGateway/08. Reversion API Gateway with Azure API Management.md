# Reversion API Gateway with Azure API Management

Welcome to the **Reversion** project! This repository provides the configuration and documentation for managing APIs using **Azure API Management (APIM)** to ensure secure, scalable, and well-documented access to backend services.

---

## 🔍 What is Azure API Management?

**Azure API Management (APIM)** is a fully managed service that enables organizations to publish, secure, transform, maintain, and monitor APIs. With APIM, Reversion centralizes access control, throttling, analytics, and developer onboarding.

## 🧠 About Reversion

**Reversion** is a microservices-based platform designed to handle version control of enterprise-grade assets. The API gateway plays a crucial role in routing and securing requests to microservices.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Centralized API Gateway** for all microservices
- **Rate limiting** and **throttling** policies
- **Security** via OAuth 2.0 and subscription keys
- **Detailed analytics** and **monitoring**
- **API versioning** and **revision control**
- **Developer portal** for API consumers

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy the Azure API Gateway using the following methods:

### Option 1: Azure Portal

1. Create an API Management instance.
2. Import OpenAPI definitions for each microservice.
3. Apply policy files using the policy editor.
4. Configure product/subscription access.

### Option 2: Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/ARM)

```bash
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --template-file templates/apim-deployment.bicep
```

## 🔐 Security and Authentication

Reversion APIs are secured using:

* **OAuth 2.0** for delegated user access
* **Subscription keys** for developer portal access
* **IP filtering** and **rate limiting** for abuse prevention

---

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

* **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics** for performance tracking
* **Alerts** for anomalies or performance degradation
* **Developer Analytics** for API usage patterns

---

## 📦 CI/CD Integration

Integrate with your DevOps pipeline using:

* **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub Actions**
* `az apim` CLI or ARM templates for automation
* Policy file version control and rollback support

---

## 👥 Developer Onboarding

* Use the **Developer Portal** to explore and test APIs
* Generate keys and tokens via the portal
* Read API documentation and try out sample requests
