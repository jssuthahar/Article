# Azure API Management Workspace

## Overview

Azure API Management (APIM) Workspace is a feature within Azure API Management that enables **role-based access** and **collaborative API development**. It allows teams to work on subsets of APIs and API operations within a logical workspace, without giving access to the entire API Management instance.

Workspaces simplify **distributed API development** by enabling departments, teams, or partners to contribute APIs in an organized and secure way.

---

## Key Features

- üîê **Scoped access control**: Grant access to specific APIs or groups of APIs.
- ü§ù **Multi-team collaboration**: Ideal for enterprises with several teams managing their own APIs.
- üîÑ **Lifecycle isolation**: Manage and deploy APIs independently per workspace.
- üì¶ **Workspace-bound resources**: Add APIs, revisions, and products specific to a workspace.

---

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise environments** with multiple teams managing different sets of APIs.
- **API-first organizations** collaborating across departments or with partners.
- **Decentralized API lifecycle management**, such as different development and deployment cycles.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An active Azure subscription
- An existing Azure API Management instance (Premium tier)
- Azure CLI or Azure Portal access

### Creating a Workspace via Azure Portal

1. Navigate to your APIM instance.
2. In the left menu, select **Workspaces**.
3. Click **+ Add** to create a new workspace.
4. Provide the required information:
   - **Workspace name**
   - **Description**
   - **Access control (optional)**

### Creating a Workspace via Azure CLI

```bash
az apim workspace create \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --service-name <your-apim-instance-name> \
  --workspace-id <your-workspace-id> \
  --display-name "<Your Workspace Display Name>" \
  --description "Optional description"
````

## Managing APIs within a Workspace

Once a workspace is created, you can:

* Import APIs scoped to the workspace.
* Define products, operations, and policies for those APIs.
* Publish APIs from the workspace to the main APIM instance.

> üîç Note: APIs in a workspace are isolated from APIs in the root instance unless explicitly shared or published.

---

## Best Practices

* Use **naming conventions** for workspace identifiers.
* Assign **RBAC roles** for secure access (e.g., APIM Developer, Reader).
* Keep **workspace APIs versioned** and documented.
* Monitor **logs and performance** separately using Azure Monitor integration.
