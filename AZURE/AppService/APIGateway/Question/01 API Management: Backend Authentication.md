# AZ-204 Exam – API Management: Backend Authentication

## 📘 Concept Overview

### What is Azure API Management?
- Azure API Management (APIM) acts as a **gateway** between clients and back-end services.  
- It provides features such as:  
  - **Security** (authentication, authorization, rate limiting)  
  - **Monitoring & analytics**  
  - **Transformation** (modify requests/responses)  
  - **Backend protection**  

### Backend Authentication in APIM
When you expose a backend API through APIM, you often need to secure the connection between APIM and the backend.  
APIM supports several methods:  
- **Client Certificates** – Recommended for securing access to **Azure resources** like App Service.  
- **Basic Authentication** – Username/password for HTTP(s) endpoints.  
- **No Auth** – Used for open/public backends (not recommended for sensitive workloads).  

👉 For **Azure App Service backends**, client certificates are the correct method.  

---

## ❓ Question #24

**Scenario:**  
You are developing a solution for a public facing API.  
- The backend API is hosted in **Azure App Service**.  
- You must configure **backend authentication** for the APIM instance.  

**Solution:** Configure **Basic gateway credentials** for the **Azure resource**.  

**Answer:** ❌ **B. No**  

### Why Incorrect:
- Basic credentials are used for **HTTP(s) endpoints**, not **Azure resources**.  
- For App Service (an Azure resource), you must use **client certificates**.  

---

## ❓ Question #25

**Scenario:** Same setup as above.  

**Solution:** Configure **Client certificate gateway credentials** for the **HTTP(s) endpoint**.  

**Answer:** ❌ **B. No**  

### Why Incorrect:
- The backend is an **Azure resource (App Service)**, not just an HTTP endpoint.  
- Client certs must be applied at the **Azure resource level**, not HTTP endpoint level.  

---

## ❓ Question #26

**Scenario:** Same setup as above.  

**Solution:** Configure **Basic gateway credentials** for the **HTTP(s) endpoint**.  

**Answer:** ❌ **B. No**  

### Why Incorrect:
- Basic auth could work for some HTTP endpoints, but:  
  - The backend is an **Azure App Service** (Azure resource).  
  - The **recommended secure method** is client certificates, not basic auth.  

---

## ❓ Question #27

**Scenario:** Same setup as above.  

**Solution:** Configure **Client certificate gateway credentials** for the **Azure resource**.  

**Answer:** ✅ **A. Yes**  

### Why Correct:
- API Management supports securing backends with **client certificates**.  
- For **Azure resources (App Service)**, this is the right approach.  
- Meets the requirement for backend authentication in this case.

|----------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----|
| Q24      | Basic credentials for Azure resource            | ❌ No          | Wrong auth type for Azure resource |
| Q25      | Client certs for HTTP endpoint                  | ❌ No          | Wrong target – backend is Azure resource |
| Q26      | Basic credentials for HTTP endpoint             | ❌ No          | Wrong auth type + backend is Azure resource |
| Q27      | Client certs for Azure resource                 | ✅ Yes         | Correct method for securing App Service |

## 📚 Topics to Study for This Area

1. **Azure API Management Basics**
   - API Gateway, Products, Policies, Backends.  

2. **Authentication Methods in APIM**
   - Backend authentication vs. frontend authentication.  
   - Client Certificates.  
   - Basic Authentication.  
   - OAuth 2.0 and Managed Identity.  

3. **Securing Backends**
   - How APIM connects securely to **App Service**.  
   - Configuring **client certificates** for Azure resources.  
   - When to use **Basic Auth** for HTTP(s) endpoints.  

4. **Azure App Service Security**
   - Authentication and authorization features.  
   - Certificates and SSL/TLS configuration.  

---

## ✅ Final Rule
- If the backend is an **Azure App Service (Azure resource)** → use **Client Certificates**.  
- If the backend is a **custom HTTP(s) endpoint** → Basic Auth or Client Certs may be used, depending on configuration.

  ## Additinal Explation


## 📌 What is Azure API Management (APIM)?

Azure API Management (APIM) is like a **security guard + manager** for your APIs.

* Clients (users/apps) never call your backend directly.
* They call **APIM**, which then securely calls your backend (App Service, Function, etc.).
* This allows you to:

  * Control **who** can access the API
  * Apply **security policies**
  * Monitor and log requests
  * Scale and manage APIs

---

## 📌 Backend Authentication in APIM

When APIM talks to your **backend service**, it needs to **prove its identity**. This is called **backend authentication**.

### Two common authentication methods:

1. **Basic Authentication (Username + Password)**

   * Works only for **generic HTTP endpoints** (non-Azure services).
   * Simple but **less secure**.

2. **Client Certificates**

   * Works for **Azure resources** (App Service, Function App, etc.).
   * APIM sends a **digital certificate** as an ID card.
   * Backend validates the certificate before accepting requests.
   * **More secure** and industry best practice.

## 📌 Exam Questions Breakdown (Q24–Q27)

**Scenario:**

* You have a backend hosted in **Azure App Service**.
* You must configure **APIM backend authentication** correctly.

---

### Q24

**Solution:** Configure **Basic credentials** for **Azure resource**

* ✅ **Answer:** ❌ No
* **Why wrong?** Azure resources do not support Basic Auth. They require client certificates.

---

### Q25

**Solution:** Configure **Client certs** for **HTTP endpoint**

* ✅ **Answer:** ❌ No
* **Why wrong?** Good idea (certs), but wrong target. The backend is an **Azure resource**, not just a plain HTTP endpoint.

---

### Q26

**Solution:** Configure **Basic credentials** for **HTTP endpoint**

* ✅ **Answer:** ❌ No
* **Why wrong?** Basic Auth works only for non-Azure APIs. Since backend is App Service (Azure), this won’t work.

---

### Q27

**Solution:** Configure **Client certs** for **Azure resource**

* ✅ **Answer:** ✅ Yes
* **Why correct?** This is the right way. App Service expects client certificate authentication from APIM.

| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Q24      | Basic credentials for **Azure resource** | ❌ No     | Wrong auth type – Azure App Service requires certs. |
| Q25      | Client certs for **HTTP endpoint**       | ❌ No     | Wrong target – backend is an Azure resource.        |
| Q26      | Basic credentials for **HTTP endpoint**  | ❌ No     | Wrong auth + wrong target.                          |
| Q27      | Client certs for **Azure resource**      | ✅ Yes    | Correct method – App Service + Client Certs.        |

---

## 📌 Key Learning for Beginners

* Always identify the **type of backend** first.

  * If it’s **Azure Resource** → Use **Client Certificates**.
  * If it’s **custom HTTP backend** → Use **Basic Auth** or certs depending on setup.
* Certificates are like **digital ID cards** – safer than usernames/passwords.
* In real-world projects, companies prefer **cert-based authentication** to meet compliance and security standards.

---

✅ **Industry Takeaway:**

> For Azure App Service backends, the **only correct method** for APIM backend authentication is **Client Certificates**.
