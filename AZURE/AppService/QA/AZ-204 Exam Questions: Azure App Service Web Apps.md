## üìò Questions & Answers

---

### ‚úÖ **Question 1**

**Question:**  
You are developing a new web service using Azure Web Apps. The web app contains a third-party library for processing Microsoft Excel files. The license stipulates that only a single instance of the library can run at a time. You need to configure the Azure App Service plan to ensure this licensing condition is met.

**Options:**

- A) Scale out the Azure App Service to multiple instances  
- B) Scale up the Azure App Service plan to a larger SKU  
- C) Configure Azure App Service to run with a single instance  
- D) Use deployment slots for Blue-Green deployment  

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**  
**C) Configure Azure App Service to run with a single instance**

**Explanation:**  
To comply with the licensing restriction that only one instance of the third-party library can run, you must ensure that the Azure App Service runs on a single instance. Scaling out would violate the terms by running multiple instances. Scaling up increases resources but does not control instance count unless constrained. Deployment slots are unrelated to instance count.

### ‚úÖ **Question 2**

**Question:**  
When deploying Azure App Service policies, you notice that some policies are not applied immediately due to deployment timing. What are common causes and how do you handle policy loss during deployment?

**Options:**

- A) Deploy policies asynchronously with retry logic  
- B) Use configuration locks to prevent policy loss  
- C) Redeploy policies after app service deployment  
- D) Use health monitoring endpoint to validate policy status  

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**  
**C) Redeploy policies after app service deployment**

**Explanation:**  
Policies may not apply correctly if deployment actions disrupt their application. It's recommended to reapply them after deployment to avoid loss.

### ‚úÖ **Question 3**

**Question:**  
How do you monitor and address performance slowdowns and connection rejections in an Azure web app running an anomaly detection service under heavy load?

**Options:**

- A) Implement auto-scaling rules to add instances  
- B) Enable Azure Application Insights performance monitoring  
- C) Use an Azure Service Bus to queue requests for anomaly detection  
- D) Restrict incoming requests during peak load hours  

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**  
**A) Implement auto-scaling rules to add instances**

**Explanation:**  
Azure App Services under heavy load can degrade or reject requests. Auto-scaling based on metrics like CPU usage ensures the app scales dynamically to maintain performance and reliability.
