# 🌐 Azure App Service - Basic Overview

## 📌 What is Azure App Service?

**Azure App Service** is a fully managed platform provided by Microsoft Azure for building, hosting, and scaling web applications and APIs.

It supports multiple programming languages such as:
- .NET and .NET Core
- Java
- Python
- PHP
- Node.js
- Ruby
- Custom Docker containers

It abstracts infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on application development rather than server setup and maintenance.

## ✅ Do's and ❌ Don'ts

### ✅ Do's

- ✔ Use **App Settings** to manage secrets and configurations (never hard-code).
- ✔ Enable **HTTPS only** for better security.
- ✔ Configure **deployment slots** (e.g., staging, production) to test before going live.
- ✔ Enable **logging and diagnostics** for troubleshooting.
- ✔ Use **Managed Identity** to access other Azure services securely.
- ✔ Regularly update your app and dependencies.

### ❌ Don'ts

- ❌ Don’t store sensitive info like connection strings in code.
- ❌ Don’t use the **Free tier** for production workloads.
- ❌ Don’t ignore logs — enable and monitor them.
- ❌ Don’t deploy directly to production without testing.
- ❌ Don’t forget to **configure scaling** if expecting high traffic.
- ❌ Don’t expose your app without basic security (auth, rate limiting, etc.)
