### 2. **What is the difference between an Availability Set and an Availability Zone?**

**Answer:**

* **Availability Set**: Protects against hardware failures in the same data center by distributing VMs across fault and update domains.
* **Availability Zone**: Physically separate data centers within a region; offers higher availability by hosting VMs in different zones.

### 3. **What is a VM Scale Set?**

**Answer:**
A Virtual Machine Scale Set is an Azure service that lets you deploy and manage a group of identical, auto-scaling VMs. It‚Äôs ideal for large-scale, stateless applications.

### 4. **Can you vertically scale an Azure VM?**

**Answer:**
Yes. You can resize a VM by changing its size (e.g., from Standard B2s to Standard D4s), but it requires the VM to restart, causing temporary downtime.

### 5. **How does Azure ensure VM high availability?**

**Answer:**
By using **Availability Sets**, **Availability Zones**, **Load Balancers**, and **VM Scale Sets**, Azure ensures high availability by spreading workloads across fault and update domains or zones.

### 6. **What types of disks are supported in Azure VMs?**

**Answer:**

* OS Disk
* Data Disk
* Temporary Disk
  Disk types include:
* **Standard HDD** (low cost, lower performance)
* **Standard SSD** (moderate performance)
* **Premium SSD** (high performance)
* **Ultra Disk** (extreme performance, low latency)
