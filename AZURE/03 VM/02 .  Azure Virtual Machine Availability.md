# 📘 Azure Virtual Machine Availability

## 🔍 Overview

Azure provides multiple options to ensure high availability and reliability of virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud without changing the infrastructure. These include:

* **Availability Sets**
* **Availability Zones**
* **Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)**

Each option helps protect workloads from failures and ensure minimal downtime.

## 📂 Key Concepts

### 1. **Availability Set**

An Availability Set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to distribute them across different physical hardware to reduce the impact of hardware failure or maintenance.

#### 🔁 Fault Domain (FD)

* Group of hardware (servers, racks, power, and network resources)
* Azure separates VMs across FDs to minimize risk of simultaneous failure

#### 🔄 Update Domain (UD)

* Group of VMs updated at the same time during maintenance
* Azure updates one UD at a time to reduce downtime

**Example:**

* 3 VMs
* 2 FDs and 5 UDs
* VMs are distributed across these to ensure high availability

### 2. **Availability Zone**

Availability Zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking.

* Each region has at least 3 AZs
* Deploying VMs across AZs ensures high resiliency
* Recommended for mission-critical workloads

### 3. **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)**

VMSS lets you deploy and manage a group of auto-scaling, load-balanced VMs.

* Integrates with Availability Zones or Sets
* Supports autoscaling
* Ensures redundancy and scalability

```
Azure Region
|
|-- Availability Zone 1
|    |-- VM1 (FD1, UD1)
|
|-- Availability Zone 2
|    |-- VM2 (FD2, UD2)
|
|-- Availability Zone 3
     |-- VM3 (FD1, UD3)

Availability Set Example:
+-------------------------+
| Availability Set        |
| +---------------------+ |
| | VM1 - FD1 - UD1     | |
| | VM2 - FD2 - UD2     | |
| | VM3 - FD1 - UD3     | |

## 🧠 Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is the difference between Availability Set and Availability Zone?

**A:** Availability Sets spread VMs across fault and update domains within the same datacenter. Availability Zones distribute VMs across physically separate datacenters in a region for higher availability.

### Q2. What is a Fault Domain?

**A:** A fault domain is a group of hardware resources that share power, network, and cooling. VMs in different FDs are protected from simultaneous failures.

### Q3. What is an Update Domain?

**A:** An update domain is a group of VMs that Azure updates at the same time during planned maintenance. Other domains remain running.

### Q4. What SLA can we achieve using Availability Sets?

**A:** 99.95% SLA when at least 2 VMs are deployed in an availability set.

### Q5. Can you use both Availability Zones and VM Scale Sets together?

**A:** Yes, VMSS supports zone-aware deployment to distribute VMs across zones for high availability.

## ✅ Best Practices

* Use **Availability Sets** for basic redundancy.
* Use **Availability Zones** for high resiliency.
* Use **VMSS with zones** for scalability and zone redundancy.
* Always distribute VMs to avoid single points of failure.
