# Azure Virtual Machine Overview

## What is an Azure Virtual Machine?

An **Azure Virtual Machine (VM)** is an on-demand, scalable computing resource provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows you to run virtualized versions of operating systems (like Windows or Linux) in the cloud, giving you the flexibility of virtualization without needing to invest in physical hardware.

Azure VMs are typically used for:
- Hosting applications or websites
- Running development or test environments
- Extending your on-premises datacenter
- Running software that requires high performance or scalability

### Key Features:
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- Scalable compute power
- Pre-built images (Windows, Ubuntu, etc.)
- Integrated with Azure services (monitoring, networking, security)

## Virtual Machine vs Physical Machine

| Feature               | Virtual Machine (VM)                                | Physical Machine (PM)                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Software-based emulation of a physical computer     | Actual hardware system                          |
| **Resource Sharing**   | Shares resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) with host system | Dedicated hardware resources                    |
| **Cost**               | Pay-as-you-go, lower upfront cost                  | High upfront cost for hardware                  |
| **Scalability**        | Easily scalable (add/remove VMs)                   | Scaling requires buying and setting up new hardware |
| **Setup Time**         | Quick deployment via cloud platforms               | Time-consuming physical setup                   |
| **Mobility**           | Can be moved or copied across hosts easily         | Not portable                                     |
| **Management**         | Managed via cloud portal or APIs                   | Managed physically on-site                      |
| **Use Case**           | Testing, development, cloud hosting                | High-performance tasks with hardware dependency |
