# üìò Azure Virtual Machines ‚Äì Availability Sets & ARM Templates

This README covers real-world Azure interview questions related to Availability Sets, ARM Templates, Fault Domains, and Update Domains. It includes explanations, best practices, correct answers, and real-time examples.

---

## ‚ùì Question 1: What is an ARM Template?

### ‚úÖ Answer:

**Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template** is a **JSON file** used to define and deploy Azure infrastructure as code (IaC).

### üîπ Key Benefits:

* Declarative and repeatable infrastructure.
* Supports automation via CI/CD pipelines.
* Allows parameterization and modular deployment.

### üìò Example Use Case:

Deploy a set of VMs, network components, and an availability set all at once in a consistent manner.

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
  "apiVersion": "2022-03-01",
  "name": "vmName",
  "properties": {
    "availabilitySet": {
      "id": "/subscriptions/.../availabilitySets/myAvailabilitySet"
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚ùì Question 2: Update Domain Count for Maintenance Resilience

> **Your company has an Azure subscription. You need to deploy a number of Azure virtual machines to the subscription by using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. The virtual machines will be included in a single availability set. You need to ensure that the ARM template allows for as many virtual machines as possible to remain accessible in the event of fabric failure or maintenance.**

> **Which of the following is the value that you should configure for the `platformUpdateDomainCount` property?**

### üîπ Options:

* A. 10
* B. 20
* C. 30
* D. 40 ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer: **D. 40**

### üîπ Explanation:

* **Update Domains (UDs)** are logical partitions used during planned maintenance.
* When Azure performs **updates on its infrastructure**, it does so by update domain to avoid downtime.
* By default, Azure uses **5 UDs**, but this can be configured up to **20** per availability set.
* If you configure `platformUpdateDomainCount` to **40**, Azure will use only **up to 20**, and ignore the rest. This allows for **maximum flexibility**, **future scalability**, and ensures **maximum uptime** during rolling maintenance.
* VMs in different update domains **will not be rebooted at the same time**.

```json
"platformUpdateDomainCount": 40
```

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Incorrect:

| Option | Issue                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 10     | Too low, limits maintenance flexibility |
| 20     | Acceptable, but not future-ready        |
| 30     | Azure still limits to 20                |
| 40     | ‚úÖ Safe, recommended, future-proof       |

### üìò Real Use Case:

If your environment requires maximum uptime during maintenance, `platformUpdateDomainCount: 40` allows Azure to place VMs in as many update domains as it supports (up to 20). Even during maintenance, only one group of VMs is rebooted at a time.

## ‚ùì Question 4: Triggered Background Job from Queue

> Your web app uses WebJobs SDK. Which service should you use to trigger background tasks from queue messages?

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer: **B. WebJobs**

### üîπ What is Azure WebJobs?

* Part of **Azure App Service**.
* Runs **background tasks** (continuously or on triggers).
* Supports **queue triggers**, timers, and blob triggers.
* Tight integration with **WebJobs SDK**.

### ‚ùå Why Other Options Are Incorrect:

| Option                | Reason                                                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logic Apps            | Great for workflows but not designed for SDK-based queue handling |
| Flow (Power Automate) | End-user automation, not dev-friendly or scalable                 |
| Functions             | Valid alternative, but question specifies **WebJobs SDK**         |

## üîö Summary of Best Practices

| Configuration               | Recommended Value | Reason                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `platformFaultDomainCount`  | 3 (Max supported) | Spread VMs across physical racks               |
| `platformUpdateDomainCount` | 40                | Azure uses max 20; 40 is safe and future-ready |
| Web background task trigger | WebJobs           | SDK specified in question                      |
