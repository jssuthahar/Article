## üîç Overview

| Feature          | Azure File Share                              | Azure File Sync                                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | Cloud-based file share accessible via SMB/NFS | Service to sync on-prem servers with Azure File Share       |
| **Primary Use**   | Direct cloud file storage                     | Hybrid storage (on-prem + cloud sync and tiering)           |
| **Access Method** | SMB, NFS, REST API                            | Local file system (NTFS) synced to Azure File Share         |
| **Platform**      | Pure cloud solution                           | Hybrid cloud + on-premises                                 |

## üìÅ What is Azure File Share?

**Azure File Share** is a fully managed cloud file storage service that supports:
- Access via **SMB** (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Mountable on VMs or on-prem devices
- Supports **Hot**, **Cool**, and **Premium** tiers

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:
- Shared storage for Azure VMs
- Lift-and-shift legacy apps needing shared drive
- Web apps or cloud-native solutions requiring file system

## üîÑ What is Azure File Sync?

**Azure File Sync** extends Azure File Share to **on-premises Windows Servers**, allowing:
- **Synchronization** of data between server and Azure
- **Cloud tiering** to keep hot data local
- **Multi-site replication**

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:
- Organizations with large existing file servers
- Multi-office sync and access
- Cloud backup with local performance
