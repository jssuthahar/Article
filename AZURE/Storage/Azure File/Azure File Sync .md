# 📂 Azure File Sync 

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Organizations with on-premises file servers face challenges such as:

- Limited local storage capacity.
- Difficulty replicating data across branch offices.
- Complex backup and disaster recovery processes.
- Need for cloud-first strategy without disrupting existing systems.

Maintaining traditional file servers across multiple offices leads to **high infrastructure costs**, **manual effort**, and **lack of centralized control**.

---

## ✅ Solution – Azure File Sync

**Azure File Sync** enables you to **centralize your file shares in Azure Files**, while keeping the **flexibility, performance, and compatibility** of a traditional Windows file server.

It allows your on-prem Windows Servers to **cache**, **sync**, and **cloud-tier** file data from Azure File Shares.

## 🔍 What is Azure File Sync?

Azure File Sync is a Microsoft service that allows you to:

- Sync on-premises Windows Server file systems to Azure File Share.
- Enable **multi-location sync** (e.g., HQ and branches).
- Support **cloud tiering**, keeping only hot data on-prem.
- Replace traditional file servers with **hybrid cloud file storage**.

## ⚙️ How Azure File Sync Works

1. **Create an Azure File Share** in a storage account.
2. **Deploy Azure File Sync agent** on your Windows Server.
3. **Register the server** with Azure.
4. **Create a Sync Group** in Azure.
5. **Add Azure File Share + Registered Server** to the sync group.
6. (Optional) Enable **Cloud Tiering** to reduce local disk usage.
