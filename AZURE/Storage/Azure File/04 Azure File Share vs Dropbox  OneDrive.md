## üéØ Why Use Azure File Share?

### ‚úÖ 1. **Enterprise Network Drive Support**
- Mount directly via **SMB or NFS** on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Looks and feels like a local drive
- Ideal for shared access from **Azure VMs** or **file servers**

> ‚ùå Dropbox/OneDrive don't support this ‚Äî you must sync files manually.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Active Directory Integration**
- Full **NTFS permissions**, group-based control
- Integrates with on-premises **Active Directory**
- Supports **Azure AD DS** for cloud-only environments

> üîê OneDrive/Dropbox don‚Äôt offer true NTFS-style permission control.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Cloud Tiering with Azure File Sync**
- Automatically stores **cold files in the cloud**
- Keeps **hot files locally** on Windows Server
- Reduces on-prem storage needs while maintaining performance

> ‚ùå Dropbox/OneDrive require full or selective sync ‚Äî uses up disk space.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Multi-User File Access with Locking**
- File locking and concurrent access support
- Ideal for **CAD files**, **Excel reports**, **engineering diagrams**, etc.

> ‚ùå Dropbox/OneDrive can create file conflicts when multiple people edit.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Seamless Azure Integration**
- Native support for **Azure VMs**, **containers**, **web apps**, and more
- Access via **PowerShell**, **Azure CLI**, or **REST APIs**

> üîó OneDrive/Dropbox are not designed for cloud-native automation.
