# 🗂️ Azure Blob Lifecycle Management – GPv1 to Archive

---

## ❓ Question

You are maintaining an existing application that uses an **Azure Blob GPv1 Premium storage account**.

* Data older than **3 months** → rarely used.
* Data newer than **3 months** → must be **available immediately**.
* Data older than **1 year** → must be **saved**, but does **not need to be immediately available**.

👉 You need to configure the account to support a **lifecycle management rule** that automatically moves blob data to **archive storage** when not modified in the last year.

---

## 📝 Solution Steps (Correct Order)

### ✅ Step 1: **Upgrade the storage account to GPv2**

* GPv1 does **not support tiering** (hot, cool, archive).
* Lifecycle rules and tiering are supported in **Blob Storage** and **GPv2 accounts**.

---

### ✅ Step 2: **Copy the data to be archived to a Standard GPv2 storage account and delete the original data**

* Premium accounts are SSD-based and don’t support tiering.
* To use lifecycle management, move the data into a **Standard GPv2 account**.

---

### ✅ Step 3: **Change the storage account access tier from Hot → Cool**

* Hot = for frequently accessed data (new < 3 months).
* Cool = for infrequent access (3–12 months).
* Archive = per-blob setting (not at account level), so lifecycle management moves blobs to Archive after 1 year.

---

## ✅ Final Answer

1. **Upgrade GPv1 → GPv2**
2. **Copy/archive data into Standard GPv2 and delete originals**
3. **Set access tier Hot → Cool (and lifecycle moves 1yr+ → Archive)**

## 👶 Kid-Friendly Analogy

Imagine you’re running a **toy library** 🎲:

* Right now, you only have **fancy golden shelves (GPv1 Premium)**. They’re super fast ⚡ but **can’t organize toys into “old” and “very old” sections**.
* First, you **upgrade to a bigger library (GPv2)** that supports multiple rooms.
* Then, you **move toys to the right rooms**:

  * **Front room (Hot)** → new toys kids play with every day.
  * **Back room (Cool)** → toys kids rarely play with but might still want.
  * **Basement (Archive)** → very old toys 🧸 that are kept safe but take hours to bring back if needed.

This way, your toy library (storage account) is cheaper and more organized.
