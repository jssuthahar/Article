# 📊 Series Question – Collecting POS Device Data with Azure

> **Note:** This question is part of a **series**. Each question in the series shares the same **scenario**, but the solution changes. Some solutions may meet the goal, others may not. Once answered, you cannot return to the question in the exam review screen.

## ❓ Scenario

You are developing an **Azure solution** to collect **point-of-sale (POS) device data** from **2,000 stores worldwide**.

* Each store has **1–5 devices**.
* A single device produces about **2 MB of data every 24 hours**.
* Device data must be **stored in Azure Blob Storage**.
* Device data must be **correlated based on a device identifier**.
* Additional stores will be added in the future (must scale).

---

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

👉 **Provision an Azure Event Grid**.

* Configure the **machine identifier** as the **partition key**.
* Enable **Capture** to automatically send the data into **Azure Blob Storage**.

---

## 📌 Question

**Does this solution meet the goal?**

Options:
A. ✅ Yes
B. ❌ No

---

## ✅ Correct Answer

**A. Yes**

---

## 📖 Explanation

### 🔹 Why Event Grid Works

* **Event Grid** is designed for **event-driven architectures**.
* It supports **massive scale** and can handle millions of events per second.
* Using the **device identifier as the partition key** ensures data from the same device is correlated.
* **Event Grid Capture** can directly write events into **Blob Storage** (or Data Lake).

### 🔹 Key Benefits for the Scenario

1. **Scalability** → Adding more stores/devices does not break the solution.
2. **Low Volume Data** → 2 MB/device/day × max 10,000 devices = ~20 GB/day (well within Event Grid & Blob Storage limits).
3. **Correlation** → Partitioning by device ID means data is grouped logically.
4. **Future Growth Ready** → New stores/devices can be plugged in without redesign.

## ⚠️ Common Confusion (Community Votes)

On **ExamTopics**, most people answered **B (No)** because they confused **Event Grid** with **Event Hub**:

* **Event Hub** = designed for *streaming telemetry & high-throughput ingestion* (IoT, POS, sensors).
* **Event Grid** = designed for *reacting to discrete events* (file upload, device status, etc.).

👉 **BUT** in this case, because the data size is small (2 MB/day/device), Event Grid with Capture is a valid and cost-effective solution.

## 📚 Reference

* [Compare Azure Messaging Services: Event Grid vs Event Hub vs Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services)

---

## ✅ Summary

* Event Grid **does meet the goal** here.
* Correct Answer: **A (Yes)**.
* Be careful: In similar questions with *much higher throughput* (e.g., GBs per second), the correct service would likely be **Event Hub**, not Event Grid.
