You are developing an application that uses a **premium block blob storage account**. The application processes a **large volume of transactions daily**.

* **Blob storage versioning** is enabled.
* You are optimizing costs by automating **Blob Storage access tiers**.
* Lifecycle management policy rules have been applied to the storage account.

**Question:** For each of the following statements, select **Yes** if true; otherwise, **No**.

### Correct Answers

| Box       | Answer  | Explanation                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Box 1** | **No**  | The rule uses **daysAfterCreationGreaterThan**, not **daysAfterModificationGreaterThan**. So it doesn‚Äôt trigger based on modification date.            |
| **Box 2** | **No**  | To act on the last access time, the policy must use **daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan**, which is not used here.                                    |
| **Box 3** | **Yes** | This statement aligns with the configured lifecycle management policy. ‚úÖ                                                                               |
| **Box 4** | **Yes** | Lifecycle management allows **transitioning blobs from cool to hot immediately when accessed**, optimizing performance for frequently accessed data. ‚úÖ |

### Explanation

* **Lifecycle management policies** in Azure Blob Storage automate:

  * Transitioning blobs between **hot, cool, and archive tiers**.
  * Deleting older blobs or previous blob versions.
* **Predicates used in policies**:

  * `daysAfterCreationGreaterThan` ‚Üí triggers after a blob is created.
  * `daysAfterModificationGreaterThan` ‚Üí triggers after a blob is modified.
  * `daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` ‚Üí triggers based on last access time (preview).
* **Premium block blob accounts** support lifecycle policies to optimize performance **without manual intervention**.
