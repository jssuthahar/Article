# üîê Azure Storage Account ‚Äì Encryption Options

Azure Storage uses **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)** to protect your data at rest automatically. You have the choice of using **Microsoft-managed keys** or your own **customer-managed keys (CMK)**.

---

## üîπ 1. Microsoft-Managed Keys (Default)

* **Description**: Azure automatically encrypts your data using Microsoft-managed keys.
* **Key Management**: Fully handled by Azure.
* **Compliance**: Meets most general compliance and security needs (e.g., ISO, HIPAA, GDPR).
* **Advantages**:

  * Zero setup.
  * Automatic key rotation and management.
* **Use Case**: Best for standard security requirements.

> ‚úÖ Recommended if you don‚Äôt need tight control over encryption keys.

## üî∏ 2. Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) in Azure Key Vault

* **Description**: You provide your own encryption keys stored in **Azure Key Vault** or **Azure Key Vault Managed HSM**.
* **Key Management**: You manage the lifecycle (create, rotate, revoke).
* **Features**:

  * Bring Your Own Key (BYOK).
  * Optionally store keys in a **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**.
* **Use Case**: Enterprises with strict compliance (e.g., financial, healthcare, government).
* **Requirements**:

  * Key Vault with configured key.
  * Correct access policies or RBAC for Storage to use the key.

> ‚úÖ Enables full control over who can decrypt your data and when.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Encryption Settings Options During Creation

| Option                         | Microsoft-Managed Keys | Customer-Managed Keys       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Enabled by Default             | ‚úÖ Yes                  | ‚ùå No (manual setup)         |
| Azure handles key rotation     | ‚úÖ Yes                  | ‚ùå You manage                |
| Requires Azure Key Vault       | ‚ùå No                   | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Hardware Security Module (HSM) | ‚ùå No                   | ‚úÖ Optional                  |
| Recommended For                | General workloads      | Highly regulated industries |

## üîÅ Encryption In Transit

* **Also important**: All data in Azure Storage is **encrypted in transit** using **HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3)**.
* You can enforce HTTPS-only access in **Networking > Configuration** settings.

## üîê Advanced Encryption Features

| Feature                      | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Double Encryption            | Data is encrypted twice with two independent encryption layers.         |
| Infrastructure Encryption    | Optional setting for highly sensitive data (e.g., government, banking). |
| Encryption Scope (Blob Only) | Assign different encryption keys to individual containers/blobs.        |

## üìù Best Practices

* ‚úÖ Use **Microsoft-managed keys** unless regulatory needs require CMK.
* ‚úÖ For CMK, use **Azure Key Vault with RBAC** over access policies for better security.
* ‚úÖ Enable **infrastructure encryption** if handling ultra-sensitive workloads.
* ‚úÖ Enable HTTPS-only access and audit key access via **Azure Monitor/Key Vault logs**.
