# üîê Azure Storage Account ‚Äì Data Protection Section

The **Data Protection** tab during storage account creation lets you configure **recovery and retention features** for Blob Storage and Azure Files.

## üìÅ For Blob Storage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Soft Delete for Blob**

* **Purpose**: Protects blobs from accidental deletion.
* **What it does**: When a blob is deleted, it's retained for the number of days you specify (default: 7 days, max: 365 days).
* **Recovery**: You can restore the deleted blob before the retention period ends.

> ‚úÖ Recommended for scenarios where accidental deletion is common.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Blob Versioning**

* **Purpose**: Automatically saves versions of blobs when they are modified or overwritten.
* **What it does**: Creates a new version of the blob every time it's changed.
* **Recovery**: You can revert to or download previous versions at any time.

> ‚úÖ Helpful for version control, rollback, and auditability.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Blob Change Feed**

* **Purpose**: Records all changes (additions, deletions, updates) to blobs in the storage account.
* **What it does**: Enables event-driven solutions and auditing.
* **Recovery/Use Case**: Helps track activity; used with tools like Azure Event Grid or for forensic purposes.

> ‚úÖ Useful for analytics, compliance, and debugging.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Point-in-Time Restore for Containers**

* **Purpose**: Restore containers to an earlier state at a specific time.
* **Requirements**:

  * Blob Versioning and Change Feed must be **enabled**.
  * Supported only for **GPv2 storage accounts** with **hierarchical namespace disabled**.
* **Recovery**: Restore an entire container to a previous point in time.

> ‚úÖ Ideal for mass recovery due to accidental deletion/corruption.

## üìÇ For Azure File Shares

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Soft Delete for File Shares**

* **Purpose**: Protects **entire file shares** from accidental deletion.
* **What it does**: Deleted file shares can be recovered within the retention period (default: 7 days).
* **Recovery**: Restore file shares through the Azure portal or PowerShell.

> ‚úÖ Critical protection for shared file systems in production.
