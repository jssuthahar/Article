# 📊 Azure Health Monitoring

## 📌 Overview

Azure provides multiple services to monitor the health, availability, and performance of your applications and resources. The two main components are **Azure Service Health** and **Azure Resource Health**, supported by **Azure Monitor**.

---

## 🔎 What is Azure Service Health?

* **Service Health** keeps you informed about **Azure-wide issues** that may affect your resources.
* It provides **real-time notifications** about outages, planned maintenance, and health advisories.
* You can set up **alerts** so your team is notified immediately when an issue impacts your services.

**Example:** If Azure announces downtime in the Southeast Asia region, Service Health will notify you.

---

## 🖥️ What is Azure Resource Health?

* **Resource Health** provides insights into the health of your **individual Azure resources** (VMs, Storage, App Services, etc.).
* It shows whether a resource is **Available, Degraded, Unavailable, or Unknown**.
* It helps differentiate between platform-wide issues and issues caused by your own configuration.

**Example:** If a VM becomes unavailable due to a hardware failure, Resource Health will display the exact issue and recovery steps.

---

## 📈 Azure Monitor

* **Azure Monitor** is the broader service that collects metrics, logs, and telemetry data.
* It integrates with **Service Health** and **Resource Health** to provide full visibility.
* You can create dashboards, set up **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** queries, and connect to tools like **Log Analytics**.

**Example:** Use Azure Monitor to track CPU usage of VMs, failures in web apps, or latency in databases.

## ⚙️ Setting Up Health Monitoring

1. Go to the **Azure Portal**.
2. Navigate to **Service Health** to check Azure-wide issues.
3. Navigate to **Resource Health** to check individual resource health.
4. Use **Azure Monitor** to collect telemetry.
5. Configure **Action Groups** to send alerts via email, SMS, or webhooks.
6. Integrate with **Log Analytics** for detailed reporting.

## 🌍 Real-World Scenarios

* **VM Downtime** → Resource Health shows the reason and mitigation.
* **Regional Outage** → Service Health reports which services/regions are affected.
* **Performance Monitoring** → Azure Monitor tracks application response times.

## ❓ Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. What is the difference between Azure Service Health and Azure Resource Health?

**Answer:** Service Health provides information on **Azure-wide issues** (like outages and maintenance), while Resource Health gives insights into the **status of individual resources** (like a VM being unavailable).

---

### 2. How do you get notified about Azure outages?

**Answer:** By setting up **alerts** in Azure Service Health with **Action Groups** (email, SMS, webhook, etc.).

---

### 3. Can Azure Resource Health show historical data?

**Answer:** Yes, Resource Health provides a history of health events over the last **14 days** for most resources.

---

### 4. How does Azure Monitor relate to Service Health and Resource Health?

**Answer:** Azure Monitor provides a **unified monitoring platform**. Service Health and Resource Health feed data into it, allowing centralized alerting, dashboards, and analytics.

---

### 5. How would you troubleshoot a VM that shows as "Unavailable" in Resource Health?

**Answer:**

1. Check Resource Health for the reason.
2. Verify if it's due to **Azure platform issues** (hardware/network failure).
3. If not, check **VM configuration** (OS crash, quota exceeded).
4. Use **Activity Logs** and **Azure Monitor metrics** to confirm root cause.

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Service Health** → Azure-wide issues (outages, maintenance).
* **Resource Health** → Individual resource availability.
* **Azure Monitor** → Central monitoring, logs, metrics, and alerts.
* Together, these tools ensure visibility, reliability, and quick troubleshooting of your Azure environment.
