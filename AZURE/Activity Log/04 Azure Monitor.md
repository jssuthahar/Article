# 📘 Azure Monitor

## 📌 Overview

**Azure Monitor** is Microsoft’s **end-to-end monitoring service** for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your Azure resources, applications, and infrastructure (cloud + on-premises).

It helps ensure your applications are available, perform well, and meet business requirements by providing:

* **Metrics** (numerical data points, e.g., CPU usage, memory, request rate).
* **Logs** (detailed event/activity information for troubleshooting).
* **Alerts** (automated responses when thresholds are breached).
* **Dashboards** (visual insights into health & performance).

---

## 🎯 Why Azure Monitor?

* Detect and fix issues **before they impact users**.
* Get **visibility across apps, infra, and networks**.
* Centralized monitoring instead of jumping between tools.
* Scale monitoring with your environment.

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🔹 1. Metrics

* Lightweight, real-time performance numbers (e.g., CPU %, response time).
* Stored in a **time-series database**.
* Useful for quick dashboards & alerts.

### 🔹 2. Logs

* Collected from Azure resources, apps, and agents.
* Stored in **Log Analytics workspace**.
* Queried with **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**.

### 🔹 3. Application Insights

* Helps monitor applications (availability, performance, failures, dependencies).
* Supports distributed tracing for microservices.

### 🔹 4. Alerts & Action Groups

* Triggered when metric/log conditions are met.
* Send **emails, SMS, push notifications, Teams messages**, or call webhooks.

### 🔹 5. Visualizations

* Built-in **workbooks**, **dashboards**, and **Power BI integration**.

## 🔍 Real-World Scenarios

1. **Track VM performance** – Set up alerts if CPU > 80% for 5 mins.
2. **App failures** – Use App Insights to trace failed requests in a web API.
3. **Regional outage tracking** – Combine with Service Health for auto-alerts.
4. **Security monitoring** – Send logs to **Microsoft Sentinel** for SIEM analysis.
5. **Proactive scaling** – Use metrics to auto-scale apps when demand increases.

## 📑 Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is Azure Monitor?

**A:** It’s Microsoft’s unified monitoring solution that collects **metrics and logs**, analyzes them with KQL, and provides insights, alerts, and integrations to maintain system health and performance.

### Q2: Difference between Metrics and Logs?

**A:**

* **Metrics**: Lightweight, numeric, near real-time (e.g., CPU, memory).
* **Logs**: Detailed, text-based, stored in Log Analytics, used for deep troubleshooting.

### Q3: How does Application Insights fit into Azure Monitor?

**A:** Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that provides **deep application monitoring** (performance, dependencies, telemetry, distributed tracing).

### Q4: What is an Action Group?

**A:** A collection of notification and automation preferences triggered when an alert fires. Example: Send email + Teams message + trigger Azure Function.

### Q5: How do you analyze logs in Azure Monitor?

**A:** Using **KQL (Kusto Query Language)** in **Log Analytics**. Example:

```kql
AzureActivity
| where OperationName == "Delete Virtual Machine"
| project ResourceGroup, Caller, ActivityStatus, TimeGenerated
```

### Q6: How do you monitor resources across multiple subscriptions?

**A:** Use a **central Log Analytics workspace** or **Azure Lighthouse** for cross-subscription visibility.

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Azure Monitor = Metrics + Logs + Alerts + Insights**.
* Collects telemetry across apps, infra, and networks.
* Integrated with App Insights, Service Health, and Sentinel.
* Essential for **performance monitoring, troubleshooting, and security visibility**.
