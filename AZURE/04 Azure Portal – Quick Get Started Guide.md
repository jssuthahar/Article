## 1. Signing In & User Account (Top-Right Corner)

* You can sign into Azure using **Microsoft account** or **Gmail account** (via Microsoft sign-in).

* You can also view your **directory (tenant)** and **change accounts** from here.

## 2. Notifications (Bell Icon)

* Shows **portal alerts, deployments, and status updates**.
* Whenever you create a resource (VM, App Service, Function etc.), progress will appear here.
