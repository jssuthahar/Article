# üåê Azure Event Grid - Complete Overview

Azure Event Grid is a fully managed event routing service that enables reactive programming with event-based architectures. It provides reliable, scalable, and near-real-time communication between services using **publish-subscribe** messaging patterns.

---

## üìå What is Azure Event Grid?

Azure Event Grid is a **serverless** event broker that allows services to publish and subscribe to events without tight coupling. It uses a **push-based model** to deliver events to various handlers such as Azure Functions, Logic Apps, WebHooks, or even custom applications.

- **Publisher**: The source that sends events (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, Resource Groups, or custom apps).
- **Subscriber**: The endpoint that processes the events (e.g., Azure Function, Webhook, Event Hub).

## ‚ùì Why Do We Need Azure Event Grid?

| Problem | Solution with Event Grid |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Tight coupling between components | Decouples producers and consumers of events |
| Polling APIs for updates | Push-based mechanism, reducing latency and resource consumption |
| Difficult to manage event-driven systems at scale | Built-in support for retry policies, dead-lettering, and filtering |
| Complex integrations between services | Native integration with most Azure services and supports custom sources |

### Key Benefits
- üîÅ **Automatic retries**
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Massive scalability**
- ‚ö° **Near real-time performance**
- üì¶ **Built-in filtering**
- üß∞ **Support for custom topics**

## üöÄ How to Use Azure Event Grid

### 1. **Enable Event Grid on a Resource**
Many Azure resources (like Blob Storage, Resource Groups, IoT Hub) can directly emit events via Event Grid.

### 2. **Create a Topic**
For custom applications:
- Create a **Custom Topic**
- Send events using HTTP POST in a specific JSON schema.

```json
{
  "id": "event-id",
  "eventType": "recordInserted",
  "subject": "/myapp/vehicles/motorcycles",
  "eventTime": "2024-10-21T19:18:00.123Z",
  "data": {
    "make": "Yamaha",
    "model": "R15"
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0"
}
````

### 3. **Create Event Subscriptions**

Subscribers can be:

* Azure Function
* Logic App
* Event Hub
* WebHook endpoint

```bash
az eventgrid event-subscription create \
  --name my-subscription \
  --source-resource-id <topic-resource-id> \
  --endpoint <subscriber-endpoint-url>
```

## üåç Where to Use Azure Event Grid

| Use Case                        | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Microservices communication** | Trigger workflows or services when an event occurs without direct calls.           |
| **Audit & Monitoring**          | Log every resource change, like VM start/stop, to a centralized system.            |
| **File processing**             | Start a Function to process an image as soon as it‚Äôs uploaded to Blob Storage.     |
| **Serverless Applications**     | Use Event Grid with Azure Functions to build completely serverless apps.           |
| **IoT Event Ingestion**         | Ingest IoT device telemetry into analytics pipelines using Event Grid + Event Hub. |

## üîß Tools & SDKs

* CLI: `az eventgrid`
* SDKs: Available in C#, JavaScript, Python, Java
* Portal: Azure Portal provides UI to configure everything
* REST API: To manage events/topics/subscriptions programmatically

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use **filters** in subscriptions to reduce noise
* Implement **dead-lettering** for failed event deliveries
* Secure endpoints using **event validation**
* Monitor with **Azure Monitor & Diagnostics**
