# ‚ö° Azure Event Grid vs. Event Grid Topic - Explained

Azure Event Grid is a powerful serverless event routing service. But there‚Äôs often confusion between **Event Grid** and **Event Grid Topic**.

This README will help you understand:

‚úÖ What is Event Grid?  
‚úÖ What is an Event Grid Topic?  
‚úÖ Key differences between the two  
‚úÖ Why and when you need custom topics  
‚úÖ Step-by-step guide to create and implement them

## üîπ What is Azure Event Grid?

Azure Event Grid is a **fully managed event routing platform** designed to simplify event-driven architectures. It connects **event sources** (publishers) with **event handlers** (subscribers).

üîÑ It uses a **publish-subscribe** model to deliver events with high availability and low latency.

---

## üî∏ What is an Event Grid Topic?

An **Event Grid Topic** is a **logical endpoint** where event publishers send their events. There are two types:

| Type              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **System Topics** | Pre-defined by Azure for specific resources (e.g., Blob Storage, Resource Groups) |
| **Custom Topics** | User-defined for custom applications to push events |

**üëâ Custom Topic is required when you want to emit events from your own application or system.**

| Feature                      | **Event Grid**                            | **Event Grid Topic**                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Definition                  | Service that routes events                | A destination (endpoint) where events are sent |
| Ownership                   | Azure-managed                             | User-defined or Azure-managed               |

## üéØ Why Do We Need Custom Event Grid Topics?

You need **Custom Event Grid Topics** when:

- You're developing an application that emits **custom domain-specific events**
- You want to **decouple microservices** with domain-driven events
- You require **fine-grained control** over event publishing and access policies

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create and Use an Event Grid Topic

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Create a Custom Topic

**Using Azure CLI:**
```bash
az eventgrid topic create \
  --name my-custom-topic \
  --resource-group my-resource-group \
  --location eastus
````

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Get the Topic Endpoint and Key

```bash
az eventgrid topic show \
  --name my-custom-topic \
  --resource-group my-resource-group \
  --query "endpoint"

az eventgrid topic key list \
  --name my-custom-topic \
  --resource-group my-resource-group \
  --query "key1"
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Publish Events to the Topic

Send a sample event using curl or code (Python, C#, Node.js, etc.)

```bash
curl -X POST https://<topic-name>.<region>-1.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events \
  -H "aeg-sas-key: <your-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[
    {
      "id": "1234",
      "eventType": "customEventType",
      "subject": "/myapp/items/item1",
      "eventTime": "2025-07-19T10:00:00Z",
      "data": {
        "itemId": "item1",
        "status": "created"
      },
      "dataVersion": "1.0"
    }
  ]'
```

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Create an Event Subscription (Webhook, Azure Function, etc.)

```bash
az eventgrid event-subscription create \
  --name my-subscription \
  --source-resource-id /subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/my-custom-topic \
  --endpoint https://myfunction.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/EventGrid?code=<key>
```

## üìå Real-World Scenario

### E-commerce Order System

* **Publisher**: Order Management System emits `OrderCreated`, `OrderShipped`, etc.
* **Topic**: `order-events-topic`
* **Subscribers**:

  * Inventory system
  * Billing system
  * Notification service

This design:

* Reduces coupling
* Scales easily
* Ensures reliability via retry/dead-lettering

| Concept              | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Grid**       | The routing system                                |
| **Event Grid Topic** | The channel to send custom events                 |
| **Why Use It**       | Enables reactive, decoupled, scalable systems     |
| **When Use It**      | For custom app events or microservice messaging   |
| **How To Use**       | Create topic ‚Üí publish event ‚Üí subscribe endpoint |
