# üì¨ Azure Event Grid (Portal-Based Guide)

## üî∑ What is Azure Event Grid?

**Azure Event Grid** is a fully managed event routing service that helps you build scalable, event-driven applications. It routes events from publishers (like Azure services or your custom apps) to event handlers (like Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or Webhooks).

## üß© Key Concepts

| Concept                | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Publisher**    | The source of the event (e.g., Blob Storage, Azure Resources, IoT Hub)     |
| **Event Handler**      | The destination that processes the event (e.g., Azure Function, Logic App) |
| **Event Subscription** | Links a publisher to a handler; lets you filter and route events           |
| **Event**              | The actual notification or message describing something that happened      |

## ‚úÖ Where to Use Event Grid

* **Storage Triggering**: Process images when uploaded to Blob Storage
* **Serverless Automation**: Automatically run Logic Apps or Azure Functions on specific changes
* **Resource Lifecycle Events**: Track VM creation/deletion and automate operations
* **IoT & Telemetry Events**: Monitor devices and systems in real time
* **Microservices Communication**: Decouple services using event-driven messaging

## üß≠ How to Check if Event Grid is Enabled in Your Subscription

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Search for **"Subscriptions"**
3. Select your **current subscription**
4. In the **left menu**, click **"Resource providers"**
5. Search for **`Microsoft.EventGrid`**
6. Ensure the status is **Registered**

> ‚úÖ If not registered, click **Register**. It usually takes a few seconds.

## üöÄ How to Create an Event Grid Setup in Portal

### üî∏ Step 1: Create an Event Grid Topic (for custom events)

1. Go to **"Event Grid Topics"** in the Azure portal.
2. Click **‚Äú+ Create‚Äù**
3. Fill in the form:

   * **Subscription**
   * **Resource group**
   * **Name** of topic (e.g., `mytopic`)
   * **Region**
4. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**

> üìå For system topics (like Storage), you don‚Äôt need to create a topic manually ‚Äì it‚Äôs generated automatically.

---

### üî∏ Step 2: Create an Event Subscription

1. Go to the **Event Grid Topic** you created (or your resource like Blob Storage)
2. Select **‚ÄúEvents‚Äù > ‚Äú+ Event Subscription‚Äù**
3. Fill in:

   * **Name** of subscription
   * **Event Schema** (default: Event Grid Schema)
   * **Endpoint type** (e.g., Azure Function, Logic App, Webhook, Service Bus)
   * **Endpoint URL or resource**
4. Optionally add **filters** (e.g., event type, subject prefix/suffix)
5. Click **Create**

---

### üî∏ Step 3: Trigger and Test

For system topics (e.g., Blob Storage):

* Upload a file to a container
* Your Azure Function, Logic App, or endpoint will receive the event

For custom topics:

* Use a tool like **Postman** or code (C#/Python/JS) to send events to the topic‚Äôs **endpoint URL**

---

## üîç Monitor Events

1. Go to your **Event Subscription**
2. Under **Metrics**, view delivery status and success/failure count
3. Go to **Diagnose and solve problems** for troubleshooting
4. You can also **enable dead-lettering** to capture failed events
