# AZ-204 Exam ‚Äì Logic Apps: Updating Definitions

## üìò What are Logic Apps and Updating Definitions?
- **Azure Logic Apps** is a cloud service that helps you automate workflows by integrating apps, data, and services with little or no code.  
- A **Logic App definition** is the underlying **JSON code** that describes the workflow (triggers, actions, conditions, etc.).  
- Updating definitions means editing this JSON directly to **add, modify, or fix** the logic of the workflow.  

---

## ‚ùì Question
You are a developer at your company.  
You need to update the **definitions** for an existing Logic App.  

**What should you use?**

A. Enterprise Integration Pack (EIP)  
B. Logic App Code View  
C. API Connections  
D. Logic Apps Designer  

**‚úÖ Correct Answer: B. Logic App Code View**

---

## ‚úÖ Why B is Correct
- The **Logic App Code View** allows you to directly edit the **JSON definition** of the workflow.  
- Steps in Azure Portal:  
  1. Sign in to Azure portal.  
  2. Go to **Logic Apps** ‚Üí select your app.  
  3. Under **Development Tools**, choose **Code View**.  
  4. Edit the JSON definition directly.  

---

## ‚ùå Why Others Are Wrong
- **A. Enterprise Integration Pack (EIP):** Used for advanced B2B/integration scenarios, not JSON editing.  
- **C. API Connections:** Used to configure connections to external services (like SQL, Office 365), not workflow definitions.  
- **D. Logic Apps Designer:** Used for visual, drag-and-drop workflow creation. It cannot directly edit raw JSON definitions.  

---

## üìö Topics to Study
- Logic Apps basics: Triggers, Actions, Connectors, Workflows  
- Logic Apps **Designer** vs. **Code View**  
- JSON schema for Logic App definitions  
- Role of **API Connections** and **Enterprise Integration Pack (EIP)**
