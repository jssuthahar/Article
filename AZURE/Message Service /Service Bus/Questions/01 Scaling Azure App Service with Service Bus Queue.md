# üöÄ HOTSPOT ‚Äì Scaling Azure App Service with Service Bus Queue

This README explains how to configure **Azure Autoscale rules** for an App Service that scales based on the number of messages in a **Service Bus queue**.

We‚Äôll cover the **HOTSPOT-style question** with **answers, explanations, and examples** step by step.

---

## üìå Scenario

* You are developing a **back-end Azure App Service**.
* The App Service **scales automatically** based on the number of messages in a **Service Bus queue**.
* A **scale-up rule already exists**:

  * If the **average queue length** of **unprocessed messages** is **greater than 1000**, the App Service **scales up**.
* Requirement: Add a **new rule** that will **continuously scale down** the App Service whenever the scale-up condition is **not met**.

## ‚ùì HOTSPOT Questions & Answers

| **Box**   | **Correct Answer**      | **Explanation**                                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Box 1** | `Service Bus Queue`     | We are scaling **based on messages in Service Bus**.                                                    |
| **Box 2** | `ActiveMessageCount`    | This metric counts all messages in the queue that are **ready for delivery** (waiting to be processed). |
| **Box 3** | `Count`                 | The aggregation we care about is the **count of messages** in the queue.                                |
| **Box 4** | `Less than or equal to` | The scale-down rule applies when the queue length is **small or empty**.                                |
| **Box 5** | `Decrease count by`     | This action **reduces the instance count** of the App Service.                                          |

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Autoscale Rule (Scale Down)

```json
{
  "metricName": "ActiveMessageCount",
  "metricResourceUri": "/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/{sb-namespace}/queues/{queue-name}",
  "operator": "LessThanOrEqual",
  "threshold": 1000,
  "timeGrain": "PT1M",
  "statistic": "Count",
  "timeWindow": "PT5M",
  "timeAggregation": "Average",
  "scaleAction": {
    "direction": "Decrease",
    "type": "ChangeCount",
    "value": "1",
    "cooldown": "PT5M"
  }
}
```

* **Metric:** ActiveMessageCount
* **Condition:** `<= 1000`
* **Action:** Decrease instance count by 1 (scale down).

## üë∂ Kid-Friendly Explanation (Story Style)

Think of your App Service as a **team of workers in a candy factory** üç¨:

1. The workers are pulling candies (messages) from a **bucket (queue)**.
2. If the bucket has **more than 1000 candies**, you hire **more workers** (scale up).
3. If the bucket has **1000 or fewer candies**, you start letting workers **go home** one by one (scale down).
4. This way, you don‚Äôt waste money paying workers to sit around when there are **no candies to pack**.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* **Box 1:** `Service Bus Queue`
* **Box 2:** `ActiveMessageCount`
* **Box 3:** `Count`
* **Box 4:** `Less than or equal to`
* **Box 5:** `Decrease count by`

This ensures your App Service:

* ‚ö° **Scales up** when many messages are waiting.
* üí§ **Scales down** when work is low.
* üí∞ Saves cost by running **only the instances you need**.
