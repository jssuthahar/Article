# 📡 Azure Event Hub Tutorial

Learn how to use **Azure Event Hubs** to handle real-time data ingestion, streaming, and processing at cloud scale. This tutorial walks you through the **why**, **where**, and **how** of using Event Hubs effectively in your architecture.

---

## 📘 What is Azure Event Hubs?

**Azure Event Hubs** is a **big data streaming platform and event ingestion service**. It can receive and process millions of events per second. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored using services like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Functions, or routed to storage and big data systems.

## ❓ Why Use Event Hubs?

| Use Case | Why Event Hub Is a Good Fit |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| 🔁 Real-time data ingestion | Handles high-throughput event streams |
| 🧪 Live telemetry & analytics | Stream data from apps, IoT devices, sensors |
| 🧩 Microservices communication | Decouples event producers and consumers |
| ⚡ Stream processing | Integrates with Stream Analytics, Kafka, Spark, etc. |
| 📦 Scalable event pipeline | Supports partitioning and parallel consumption |

## 🧭 Where to Use Event Hubs

- **IoT Solutions**: Stream telemetry data from thousands of devices
- **Finance Apps**: Process stock ticks, payments, or fraud events
- **Retail Systems**: Track customer activity in real time
- **Social Platforms**: Analyze live user interactions or trends
- **Gaming Apps**: Capture in-game events and metrics for analytics

## 🛠️ How to Use Event Hubs (Quick Start)

### 1. Create Event Hub Namespace and Hub
- Go to Azure Portal → Event Hubs → Create namespace
- Within the namespace, create an Event Hub

### 2. Set Up Shared Access Policies
- Navigate to **Shared Access Policies**
- Copy the **Connection String–Primary Key** for sender/receiver apps

### 3. Send Events (Producer App - C# Example)
```csharp
var producerClient = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString, eventHubName);
using EventDataBatch eventBatch = await producerClient.CreateBatchAsync();
eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello Event Hub")));
await producerClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
````

### 4. Receive Events (Consumer App)

```csharp
var consumer = new EventHubConsumerClient(
    EventHubConsumerClient.DefaultConsumerGroupName,
    connectionString, eventHubName);

await foreach (PartitionEvent evt in consumer.ReadEventsAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Received: {Encoding.UTF8.GetString(evt.Data.Body.ToArray())}");
}
```

### 5. Monitor Activity

* Use **Metrics** and **Diagnostics** in the Azure portal to monitor throughput and latency.

## 🧩 Integration Options

| Service                | Use Case                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Azure Stream Analytics | Real-time analytics & SQL-like queries |
| Azure Functions        | Event-driven serverless processing     |
| Azure Data Lake        | Persisting raw event data              |
| Apache Kafka           | Use Event Hub as Kafka endpoint        |
| Power BI               | Real-time dashboard and alerts         |

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

* Use **Managed Identity** for authentication (instead of connection strings)
* Enable **Capture** to archive events to Blob Storage or Data Lake
* Use **partition keys** to ensure ordered processing
* Scale using **throughput units** or **Event Hub Dedicated tiers**
* Set up **geo-disaster recovery** for mission-critical applications
