# 📦 Azure Storage Queue

Azure Storage Queue is a simple messaging service for storing large numbers of messages. It helps **decouple application components**, enabling scalable and reliable communication between producers and consumers.

---

## 📌 Why Use Azure Storage Queue?

- Decouple frontend and backend processing
- Buffer workloads (e.g., image processing, order handling)
- Durable message storage
- Simple API and low cost

---

## 🚀 Common Use Cases

- Background job processing
- Asynchronous task execution
- Message buffering for bursty workloads
- File or image post-processing
- IoT device data buffering

## 📊 Technical Specifications & Limits

| Feature                        | Value / Limit |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| ✅ **Max message size**        | **64 KB** (base64 encoded) |
| 📤 **Max messages/sec**        | ~2,000+ messages per second per queue (depends on storage account throughput) |
| 📂 **Max queues per account** | **Unlimited** (subject to overall storage account limits) |
| 💾 **Max message TTL**         | **7 days** (default is 7 days, configurable up to 7) |
| ⏳ **Visibility timeout**      | 1 second to 7 days |
| 🕐 **Message lifetime**        | Up to 7 days (after that it's deleted if not dequeued) |
| 🔒 **Authentication**         | Azure AD, Shared Access Signature (SAS), Shared Key |
| 📊 **Queue load visibility**  | Approximate message count via `ApproximateMessageCount` |
| 🔁 **Peek-lock (Hidden)**     | Visibility timeout hides the message until processed |
| 📄 **Message format**         | Text-based; JSON recommended for structured data |
| 🗃 **Max messages stored**     | Limited by total storage account capacity (up to 500 TB) |

---

## 📦 Message Format

- Stored as **Base64-encoded UTF-8 text**
- Can hold any serializable object (JSON, XML, plain text)

### Example JSON Message:
```json
{
  "taskId": "12345",
  "operation": "resizeImage",
  "blobUrl": "https://myblob.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/image1.png"
}
````

---

## 🧭 Visibility Timeout

* After a message is dequeued, it becomes **invisible** to others for the **visibility timeout period**.
* If not deleted within that period, it becomes **visible again**.
* This prevents **double processing** unless the message fails to process.

---

## 🔐 Authentication Methods

Azure Storage Queues support multiple secure access methods:

| Method     | Description                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Shared Key | Full access using storage account key   |
| SAS Token  | Delegated access for specific actions   |
| Azure AD   | Role-based access with managed identity |

---

## 📊 Monitoring Queue Load

You can get an estimate of how many messages are in the queue using:

```csharp
queue.FetchAttributes();
int messageCount = queue.ApproximateMessageCount ?? 0;
```

---

## ⚠️ Considerations

* **Not transactional**: No built-in transaction like Service Bus.
* **No guaranteed order**: FIFO is not strictly enforced.
* **No duplicate detection**: App must handle idempotency if needed.

## 💡 Comparison with Other Azure Messaging Services

| Feature              | Azure Storage Queue | Azure Service Bus            | Azure Event Grid           |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Message Size         | 64 KB               | 256 KB+                      | Small JSON Event           |
| TTL                  | Up to 7 days        | Unlimited (with dead-letter) | N/A                        |
| Ordering             | No strict FIFO      | FIFO with sessions           | N/A                        |
| Multiple Subscribers | ❌                   | ✅ Topics/Subscriptions       | ✅                          |
| Best Use Case        | Simple queuing      | Enterprise messaging         | Reactive serverless events |
