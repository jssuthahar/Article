# B2B and B2C Identity Models in Azure Active Directory

## üîç Overview

In cloud-based applications, handling user identities securely and efficiently is crucial. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) offers two identity models for this:

- **B2B (Business-to-Business)**: Enables external partners, vendors, or other organizations to access your applications using their own credentials.
- **B2C (Business-to-Consumer)**: Enables end-users (consumers) to sign up or sign in using their personal accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft accounts).

## üè¢ B2B (Business-to-Business)

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Use Case
A software development company (e.g., JSDevBrains) collaborates with a logistics company to build a supply chain portal. External users from the logistics partner need access to internal applications securely.

### üîß Key Features
- External users (guests) use their organization's credentials
- Centralized access control and policies
- MFA and Conditional Access supported
- Seamless collaboration via Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, etc.

### üöÄ Steps to Enable B2B in Azure

1. **Login to Azure Portal**: https://portal.azure.com
2. **Navigate to Azure Active Directory**
3. Go to **Users > New Guest User**
4. Enter guest user email and invite
5. Assign roles or permissions via **Enterprise Applications** or **Groups**
6. Optionally, configure:
   - **Conditional Access Policies**
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - **Access Reviews**

> üìå Tip: External users receive an email invitation to join your directory and access shared resources.
