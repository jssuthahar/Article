# Azure AD Connect

**Azure AD Connect** is a Microsoft tool that connects and synchronizes your on-premises Active Directory (AD) with **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**, enabling a **hybrid identity** solution. It is a key component for organizations transitioning to the cloud while maintaining on-prem infrastructure.

## üîç What is Azure AD Connect?

Azure AD Connect allows you to:

- Synchronize on-premises users, groups, and passwords to Azure AD.
- Enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** between on-prem AD and cloud services.
- Maintain identity consistency across both environments.
- Provide access to Microsoft 365, Azure, and SaaS apps using on-prem credentials.
