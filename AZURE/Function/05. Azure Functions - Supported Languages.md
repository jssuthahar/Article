## 🧩 Language Details

### 1. **C#**

* ✅ In-process (faster, tightly integrated with Azure SDK).
* ✅ Isolated process (better compatibility, cross-version support).
* 🔧 Excellent Visual Studio and Azure CLI tooling support.
* 👌 Recommended for enterprise and production use.

### 2. **JavaScript / TypeScript**

* 🔁 Event-driven, non-blocking I/O using Node.js.
* 🔧 Fast prototyping and development using VS Code.
* 📦 Supports npm packages for extending functionality.

### 3. **Python**

* 🐍 Supported versions: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 (in Azure-hosted environments).
* 🚀 Easy to use for AI/ML, automation, data processing.
* 🛠️ Deploy via VS Code, CLI, or GitHub Actions.

### 4. **Java**

* ☕ Supports Maven and Gradle for builds.
* 💼 Great for enterprise-level systems.
* 🗂️ Structured like a traditional Java project with function annotations.

### 5. **PowerShell**

* 🔄 Ideal for Azure automation, infrastructure scripting.
* 🔒 Runs on PowerShell Core (cross-platform).
* 👮 Great for DevOps and administrators.

### 6. **F#**

* 🧪 Experimental support; use with caution.
* 🎯 Best used in .NET in-process model.
* ❗ Not recommended for new production systems.

### 7. **Custom Handlers**

* ⚙️ Build with any language that supports HTTP (e.g., Go, Rust, PHP).
* 🗃️ Create your own worker process.
* 🧩 Good for languages not natively supported.
