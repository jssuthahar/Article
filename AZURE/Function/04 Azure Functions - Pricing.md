## üîπ Overview

Azure Functions is a **serverless compute service** that enables you to run event-driven code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. It supports multiple languages and integrates easily with other Azure services.

## üí∞ Azure Function Pricing

Azure Functions pricing is primarily based on the **hosting plan** and **execution model** you choose:

### 1. **Consumption Plan (Default)**

* **Pricing**: Pay only for the time your code runs.
* **Execution**: Automatically scales based on the number of incoming events.
* **Free Grant**:

  * 1 million requests per month
  * 400,000 GB-s of resource consumption per month
* **Best For**: Lightweight functions, low-volume or unpredictable workloads.

### 2. **Premium Plan**

* **Pricing**: Based on number of core seconds and memory used.
* **Execution**: Pre-warmed instances to reduce cold start time.
* **Features**:

  * VNET integration
  * Unlimited execution duration
  * Predictable performance
* **Best For**: Enterprise-scale applications, APIs, or workloads with constant or high-demand.

### 3. **Dedicated (App Service) Plan**

* **Pricing**: Based on App Service Plan pricing.
* **Execution**: Functions run on dedicated virtual machines.
* **Best For**: Existing App Service environments with reserved capacity.

| **Admin**                            | Requires the master key. Provides full access, including to all functions within the app.                  |
| **System-Assigned Managed Identity** | Securely calls other Azure services without managing credentials.                                          |
| **User-Assigned Managed Identity**   | Use a pre-created identity to access services, enabling identity reuse across resources.                   |
| **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** | Azure AD roles used for managing function app resource access from Azure Portal or CLI.                    |
