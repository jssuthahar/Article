# üöÄ Azure Cosmos DB + Function App with IoT Notification

This README explains a real-world scenario involving Azure Cosmos DB, Function Apps, and IoT-triggered email notifications. The task is to design a solution that meets scalability, cost-efficiency, and notification requirements.

---

## üìò Scenario Summary

You're building a cloud solution that includes:

* **Azure Cosmos DB** with **SQL API** to store IoT data.
* A **web application** writes new data to Cosmos DB **daily**.
* You need to:

  1. **Trigger a Function App** when new data is added.
  2. **Send email notifications** when IoT-related data arrives.
  3. **Reduce compute cost** (i.e., serverless or consumption-based billing).

---

## ‚ùì Question:

> You are creating an Azure Cosmos DB account that makes use of the SQL API. Data will be added to the account every day by a web application.
>
> You need to ensure that an **email notification** is sent when **information is received from IoT devices**, and that **compute cost is reduced**.
>
> You decide to deploy a **Function App**.
>
> **Which of the following should you configure the function app to use?**

| Item                  | Description                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cosmos DB Trigger** | Automatically starts the function when a document is inserted or modified. |
| **SendGrid Binding**  | Sends email notifications from the function.                               |
| **Consumption Plan**  | Minimizes compute cost by using serverless billing model.                  |

## ‚úÖ Final Answer:

To meet all requirements:

1. **Trigger Type:** Cosmos DB Trigger
2. **Notification Service:** SendGrid Output Binding
3. **Hosting Plan:** Consumption Plan

These selections ensure low cost, automatic scaling, and email notifications on IoT data arrival.

To meet all requirements:

1. **Trigger Type:** Cosmos DB Trigger
2. **Notification Service:** SendGrid Output Binding
3. **Hosting Plan:** Consumption Plan

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-time Architecture Flow

```plaintext
[Web App]
   ‚¨á Writes data daily
[Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)]
   ‚¨á Change Feed Trigger
[Azure Function App]
   ‚¨á
[SendGrid Binding] ‚Üí üìß Email to Alert Team
```

## üí° Key Technologies

### üî∏ Azure Cosmos DB Trigger

* Monitors changes using **change feed**.
* Automatically triggers the function on insert or update.

### üî∏ Consumption Plan

* Serverless plan: **Pay only for usage**.
* Automatically scales and ideal for sporadic workloads like IoT bursts.
  
### üî∏ SendGrid Binding

* Integrated with Azure Functions to send transactional emails.
* Requires SendGrid API key and verified sender.
