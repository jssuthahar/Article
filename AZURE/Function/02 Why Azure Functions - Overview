# Why Azure Functions - Overview

## What is Azure Function?

**Azure Function** is a **serverless compute service** introduced by Microsoft in **2016** as part of the Azure cloud platform. It allows developers to run small pieces of code, known as "functions", **on-demand** without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

It follows the **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)** model, enabling developers to focus on **business logic** rather than infrastructure and boilerplate code.

## Why Use Azure Functions?

While we already have **Virtual Machines** and **Azure App Services**, Azure Functions bring unique benefits:

| Feature                       | Azure VM         | Azure App Service     | Azure Function               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Infrastructure management     | Required         | Minimal               | Abstracted by Azure          |
| Billing model                 | Per usage/hour   | Per usage/hour        | **Pay-per-execution**        |
| Scalability                   | Manual/Auto      | Auto                  | **Auto and instant**         |
| Focus                         | Full application | Web app/microservices | **Single-purpose functions** |
| Cold start (serverless delay) | N/A              | Minimal               | May occur on first run       |

## Key Features

* **Run on Demand**: Functions are triggered by **specific events**, such as:

  * HTTP requests
  * Timers (e.g., run daily at 8 AM)
  * Azure Queue/Blob storage changes
  * Cosmos DB events
  * Event Grid messages
  * Service Bus messages

* **Flexible Scheduling**: You can run a function:

  * **Once** (on-demand)
  * **Every time** an event occurs
  * **Every day** or at **custom intervals** using CRON expressions

* **Multiple Language Support**:
  Azure Functions support many languages, including:

  * C#
  * JavaScript/Node.js
  * Python
  * Java
  * PowerShell
  * TypeScript
  * Custom handlers for any language (via HTTP)

* **Lightweight and Fast**:
  Functions are optimized for short-lived operations with fast startup times. Ideal for:

  * Data processing
  * Event-driven tasks
  * Webhooks and APIs
  * Background jobs

## Benefits

* ✅ **Serverless** – Azure manages the infrastructure.
* ✅ **Scalable** – Auto-scales based on demand.
* ✅ **Cost-Effective** – Pay only when your function runs.
* ✅ **Focus on Business Logic** – No need to write plumbing/boilerplate code.
* ✅ **Quick Development** – Ideal for rapid prototyping and automation.

## When to Use Azure Functions?

Use Azure Functions when:

* You want to **respond to events** (HTTP, timer, queue, blob, etc.)
* You need **scheduled jobs** (daily reports, backups, etc.)
* You're building **lightweight APIs**
* You want to **offload background tasks** from your main app
* You prefer a **microservices** or **event-driven** architecture

---

## Example Use Cases

* Sending notifications after file upload
* Automatically resizing images
* Processing data from IoT devices
* Generating daily sales reports
* Handling webhook events

---

## Conclusion

Azure Functions provide a **modern, scalable, and cost-efficient** way to run code in the cloud. Whether you're automating workflows, processing data, or building event-driven applications, Azure Functions help you **move faster** by focusing on what matters most: your **business logic**.
