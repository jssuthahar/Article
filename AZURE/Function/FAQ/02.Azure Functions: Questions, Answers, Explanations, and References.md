### Question 1: Investigate Azure Function App Error Message in Development Environment

**Reference**: Page 379  
**Question**: You need to investigate the Azure Function app error message in the development environment. What should you do?

**Options**:
- A. Connect Live Metrics Stream from Application Insights to the Azure Function app and filter the metrics.
- B. Create a new Azure Log Analytics workspace and instrument the Azure Function app with Application Insights.
- C. Update the Azure Function app with extension methods from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to log events by using the log instance.
- D. Add a new diagnostic setting to the Azure Function app to send logs to Log Analytics.

**Answer**: A  
**Explanation**: Azure Functions provide built-in integration with Application Insights, including a Live Metrics Stream option that shows metrics data in near real-time. This is the most straightforward method to monitor real-time behavior, performance, and check for failures/errors during development. Other options either involve extra configuration steps or send diagnostics to Log Analytics, which is more suitable for long-term or production monitoring but not for immediate investigation.

### Question 2: Securing Azure Functions to Meet Security Requirements

**Reference**: Page 308  
**Question**: You must secure Azure Functions for centralized management of configuration data encrypted with a company-provided RSA-HSM key. Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and managed identities. Which two actions should you perform?

**Options**:
- A. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Key Vault with soft-delete and purge-protection features enabled.
- B. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Blob storage with an immutability policy applied to the container.
- C. Create a free tier Azure App Configuration instance with a new Azure AD service principal.
- D. Create a standard tier Azure App Configuration instance with an assigned Azure AD managed identity.
- E. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Cosmos DB applying built-in policies for customer-managed keys.

**Answer**: A, D  
**Explanation**: Azure Key Vault is the recommended location to securely store RSA-HSM keys, supporting features like soft-delete and purge protection to safeguard keys from accidental or malicious deletion. Azure App Configuration (standard tier) supports integration with managed identities for centralized and secure configuration management across environments, suitable for Azure Functions. Other options are either insecure or do not fully meet the requirement of using managed identities and hardware-secure key handling.

### Question 3: Authentication and Profile Management for Azure Functions

**Reference**: Pages 305, 300  
**Question**: How should you configure the system to reliably identify delivery driver profile information stored in Azure Active Directory by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website?

**Options**:
- A. Use Azure Identity library
- B. Use Managed Identities for Azure resources
- C. Authenticate with an Azure AD service principal

**Answer**: A, B  
**Explanation**: Azure Functions should use managed identities to authenticate securely without managing credentials. The Azure Identity client library helps integrate Azure AD authentication seamlessly in code. This approach supports secure communication between Azure Functions and Azure AD for identity management.

### Summary

- **Monitoring**: Use Application Insights Live Metrics for real-time diagnostics.
- **Security**: Store keys in Azure Key Vault and use Azure App Configuration with managed identities.
- **Authentication**: Use Azure Identity library and managed identities for secure access.
