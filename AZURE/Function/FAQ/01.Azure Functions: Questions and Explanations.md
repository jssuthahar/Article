### Q1: Investigate Azure Function app error message in development environment

**Question:**  
You need to investigate the Azure Function app error message in the development environment. What should you do?

**Options:**  
A. Connect Live Metrics Stream from Application Insights to the Azure Function app and filter the metrics.  
B. Create a new Azure Log Analytics workspace and instrument the Azure Function app with Application Insights.  
C. Update the Azure Function app with extension methods from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to log events by using the log instance.  
D. Add a new diagnostic setting to the Azure Function app to send logs to Log Analytics.

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**  
Azure Functions provides built-in integration with Application Insights. Live Metrics Stream lets you view metrics data in near real-time, which is useful to monitor function app behavior, performance, and failures. Connecting Live Metrics Stream helps you investigate errors instantly.

### Q2: Securing Azure Functions to meet centralized config and encryption requirements

**Question:**  
You need to secure the Azure Functions to meet the security requirements which include centralized management and distribution of configuration data encrypted with a company-provided RSA-HSM key, Azure AD authentication, and managed identities usage. Which two actions should you perform?

**Options:**  
A. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Key Vault with soft-delete and purge-protection features enabled.  
B. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Blob storage with an immutability policy applied to the container.  
C. Create a free tier Azure App Configuration instance with a new Azure AD service principal.  
D. Create a standard tier Azure App Configuration instance with an assigned Azure AD managed identity.  
E. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Cosmos DB. Apply the built-in policies for customer-managed keys and allowed locations.

**Answer:** A, D

**Explanation:**  
Azure Key Vault is the recommended place for storing cryptographic keys (RSA-HSM) securely, supporting features like soft-delete and purge-protection. For centralized configuration management, Azure App Configuration standard tier with managed identity works well with Azure Functions for secure config distribution.

### Q3: Processing flow with Azure Functions and storage

**Scenario:**  
Processing is performed by an Azure Function using runtime version 2. Once processing completes, results are stored in Azure Blob Storage and an Azure SQL database. An email summary with a link to the processing report is sent to the user. The link must remain valid even if forwarded to another user.

**Insight:**  
This scenario involves output persistence in Blob Storage and SQL database after Azure Function execution, and sharing a link that should not be user-specific but generally accessible, implying a publicly accessible or securely shared Blob Storage URL or Azure SQL report link with appropriate access controls.

### Q4: Authentication and identification of delivery driver profile information via Azure Function

**Scenario:**  
Store delivery driver profile info in Azure Active Directory by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.

**Insight:**  
Use managed identities and Azure Identity library for authentication â€” recommended approach for secure access. Managed identities streamline credential management when Azure Functions access Azure AD or other services.
