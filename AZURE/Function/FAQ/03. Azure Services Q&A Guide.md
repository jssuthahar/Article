### Question 1: Investigate Azure Function App Error Message in Development Environment

**Question:** You need to investigate the Azure Function app error message in the development environment. What should you do?  
**Options:**  
A. Connect Live Metrics Stream from Application Insights to the Azure Function app and filter the metrics.  
B. Create a new Azure Log Analytics workspace and instrument the Azure Function app with Application Insights.  
C. Update the Azure Function app with extension methods from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to log events by using the log instance.  
D. Add a new diagnostic setting to the Azure Function app to send logs to Log Analytics.  
**Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Azure Functions provide built-in integration with Application Insights, including a Live Metrics Stream option that shows metrics data in near real-time. This is the most straightforward method to monitor real-time behavior, performance, and check for failures/errors during development.

### Question 2: Securing Azure Functions to Meet Security Requirements

**Question:** You must secure Azure Functions for centralized management of configuration data encrypted with a company-provided RSA-HSM key. Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and managed identities. Which two actions should you perform?  
**Options:**  
A. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Key Vault with soft-delete and purge-protection features enabled.  
B. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Blob storage with an immutability policy applied to the container.  
C. Create a free tier Azure App Configuration instance with a new Azure AD service principal.  
D. Create a standard tier Azure App Configuration instance with an assigned Azure AD managed identity.  
E. Store the RSA-HSM key in Azure Cosmos DB applying built-in policies for customer-managed keys.  
**Answer:** A, D  
**Explanation:** Azure Key Vault is the recommended location to securely store RSA-HSM keys, supporting features like soft-delete and purge protection. Azure App Configuration (standard tier) supports integration with managed identities for centralized and secure configuration management across environments.

### Question 3: Authentication and Profile Management for Azure Functions
 
**Question:** How should you configure the system to reliably identify delivery driver profile information stored in Azure Active Directory by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website?  
**Options:**  
- Use Azure Identity library  
- Use Managed Identities for Azure resources  
- Authenticate with an Azure AD service principal  
**Answer:** Use Azure Identity library, Use Managed Identities  
**Explanation:** Azure Functions should use managed identities to authenticate securely without managing credentials. The Azure Identity client library helps integrate Azure AD authentication seamlessly in code.

### Question 4: Implement Messaging Solution for Queue Data from Mobile Application

**Scenario:** You need to process queue data with the following:  
- Queue size must not exceed 80 GB  
- Use FIFO ordering  
- Minimize Azure costs  
**Proposed Solution:** Use Azure Service Bus Queue with .NET API, trigger Azure Function with Service Bus Queue trigger.  
**Question:** Does the solution meet the goal?  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Explanation:** Azure Service Bus Queue supports FIFO message processing, large queue size, and reliable delivery. Azure Functions can be triggered by Service Bus and process messages efficiently.

### Question 5: Collecting POS Device Data from Multiple Stores
 
**Scenario:**  
- Device produces 2 MB data every 24 hours  
- Data must be stored in Blob storage, correlated by device ID  
- Solution proposed: Use Azure Event Grid with filtering on device identifier  
**Question:** Does the solution meet the goal?  
**Answer:** No  
**Explanation:** Event Grid is best for lightweight event notification, not large data ingestion or correlation. Azure Service Bus is better suited for processing and ordering larger and complex transactional data streams like POS data.

### Question 6: Configure Web Apps for Application Insights Telemetry

**Sequence of actions for enabling Application Insights:**  
1. Create an Application Insights resource  
2. Copy the connection string  
3. Configure the Application Insights SDK in the web app  
**Explanation:**  
- The Application Insights resource collects telemetry data.  
- The connection string connects the app telemetry to this resource.  
- The SDK injects telemetry collection into the app code or environment.
