# Introduction to Azure Subscription

Welcome to this guide on **Azure Subscription** â€” the foundation of using Microsoft Azure. In this session, you'll learn what an Azure subscription is, why it's important, how billing works, and how to manage access and limits effectively.

## ðŸ”‘ What is an Azure Subscription?

An **Azure Subscription** is an agreement with Microsoft to use Azure services. It acts as a **container** for:
- Resources (VMs, storage, databases, etc.)
- Billing and payment
- Access control

> ðŸ“¦ Think of it like a utility account â€” you use services and get billed monthly.

## ðŸ§± Hierarchy in Azure

```plaintext
Azure Account (Email / Microsoft ID)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Subscription(s)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Resource Groups
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Resources
````

You can have **multiple subscriptions** under one Azure account.

## ðŸ’³ Types of Azure Subscriptions

| Subscription Type | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Free Trial        | â‚¹13,300 (\$200) free credit for 30 days        |
| Pay-As-You-Go     | Pay only for what you use                      |
| Student           | Free \$100 credit with no credit card required |
| Enterprise        | For large organizations (via volume licensing) |
| CSP               | Through Cloud Solution Providers (resellers)   |

## ðŸ§¾ Billing & Cost Management

Each subscription has its **own billing**:

* You can view costs in the **Azure Cost Management** blade.
* Set **budgets** and **alerts** to avoid overspending.
* Billing is based on usage of services like compute, storage, networking, etc.

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Access Control (RBAC)

You can **assign roles** to users at the subscription level:

* **Owner** â€“ full control (including billing)
* **Contributor** â€“ can manage resources, but not billing
* **Reader** â€“ view-only access

> âœ… Best practice: Use **least privilege** when assigning roles.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Subscription Limits & Quotas

Each subscription comes with **default limits**, e.g.:

* 10,000 resource groups
* 250 storage accounts
* VM quotas by region

These can usually be **increased by request**.

---

## ðŸ§ª Real-Life Example

### Scenario:

Youâ€™re managing two projects:

* One for internal use by Chennai office
* One for public users in Bangalore

You create:

* `ChennaiDev Subscription` â€“ for internal tools
* `BangaloreApp Subscription` â€“ for the customer-facing app

Each subscription has its **own billing, access control, and limits**.

## ðŸ“Š Why Use Multiple Subscriptions?

| Use Case                     | Benefit                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Separate billing per project | Easier cost tracking                  |
| Different access teams       | Improve security                      |
| Environment isolation        | Separate prod/test environments       |
| Legal or compliance needs    | Isolate data for audit/region reasons |

## âœ… Summary

| Concept            | Description                               |
