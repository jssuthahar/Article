# Day 4 ‚Äì Azure Networking & Virtual Machines

Welcome to **Day 4** of the Azure series! Today we‚Äôll cover foundational networking concepts (home/office/virtual), IP addressing, and key VM topics in the Azure cloud.
You‚Äôll work through the following articles:

## üéØ What you will learn today

* The architecture of a **home network** and how it parallels to Azure virtual networking.
* How **IP addressing** works (IPv4, IPv6, private vs public) and implications for cloud networks.
* A high-level overview of networking across **home**, **office**, and **virtual (cloud)** environments.
* Fundamentals of provisioning a VM in Azure: what is a VM, when to use it.
* VM availability options: how Azure ensures uptime, availability sets/zones, redundancy strategies.

---

## üîß How to use this day

1. Read each of the five linked articles in order.
2. For each article, take notes of key terms (e.g., IP subnet, VNet, availability zone).
3. At the end of each reading, answer a short self-check:

   * Can I explain this concept in my own words?
   * Can I map it to a real-world scenario (e.g., home router vs Azure VNet)?
4. If you have Azure access, try a **hands-on** exercise:

   * Create a simple VNet, subnet and deploy a VM.
   * Try configuring availability options (zones/sets) and observe.
5. Write down any questions or unclear parts; we‚Äôll review them in Day 5.

## ‚úÖ Outcome by end of Day 4

By the end of today you should be able to:

* Describe how networking works in home/office and how it transfers to Azure.
* Differentiate between IP address types and understand their role in Azure networking.
* Explain what a VM is in Azure, how to deploy one, and what availability means.
* Confidently tell someone: ‚ÄúIn Azure, I would architect a network with ‚Ä¶ and deploy a VM with ‚Ä¶‚Äù

## üìÖ What‚Äôs next (Day 5 Preview)

Tomorrow we‚Äôll dive deeper into **Azure Storage & Data Services** ‚Äî we‚Äôll explore managed storage accounts, blob services, Azure SQL, and how they interplay with networking and VMs.
