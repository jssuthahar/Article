## 🛠 How to Use This Repository

* **Read in sequence**: It is recommended to follow in the order above as they build on each other (from VM creation → cost‑management → web server setup → hosting → .NET deployment).
* **Hands‑on practice**: Use the guides while actually spinning up an Azure VM in your trial/subscription.
* **Reference for interviews/certifications**: These topics map well to Azure infrastructure, deployment, cost management — useful for roles like yours (Sr. Account Technology Strategist).
* **Modify and extend**: Feel free to adapt parts of the guides to your scenario (e.g., different OS, Linux VMs, other web frameworks).

## 🎯 Why this matters for your journey

Since you’re preparing for senior technology roles (e.g., at Microsoft Corporation) and building cloud‑based solutions:

* Understanding VM Lifecycle (create, stop, deallocate, host) is fundamental.
* Cost management is key when discussing enterprise cloud solutions or advising clients.
* Hosting web apps on VMs (especially .NET) bridges your development background (C#) with infrastructure ops.
* Demonstrating hands‑on ability with Azure VM + web hosting + cost optimisation will strengthen your strategic techno‑business conversations.
