# 💰 Azure Budget & Cost Calculator: Use Case & Real-Time Support

## 📘 Overview

This repository provides guidance and resources for calculating **budget and cost estimates** using **Azure Pricing Calculator** and **Azure Cost Management tools**. It explains how to plan, estimate, and monitor the cost of hosting a real-world project on Azure — such as a web application — with a practical use case and team support story.

## 🚀 Use Case Scenario

### 🧑‍💻 Project: Host a Business Website on Azure

Our team is tasked with developing and deploying a responsive web application for a small-to-medium business. The client wants to host the app on Microsoft Azure. To help with budgeting, we use **Azure Pricing Calculator** to estimate the overall cost before deployment.

## 📊 Azure Cost Planning Process

### ✅ Step 1: List the Required Services

We need to identify and estimate the cost of the following Azure components:

| Azure Service           | Purpose                          | Example Configuration                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **App Service Plan**    | Host the web app                 | B1 (Basic, 1 instance)                    |
| **Azure SQL Database**  | Store structured data            | Basic/Standard tier                       |
| **Azure Storage**       | Store files like images/docs     | 100 GB in Hot tier                        |
| **Azure CDN**           | Speed up content delivery        | Standard Microsoft tier                   |
| **Azure DNS**           | Manage custom domain             | 1 domain                                 |
| **Azure Monitor**       | Monitor health and performance   | Log Analytics + Application Insights     |
| **Azure Backup**        | For business continuity          | Daily backup for DB and App service      |
| **Azure Key Vault**     | Secure secrets and keys          | Standard tier                             |

## 🔢 Using Azure Pricing Calculator

You can access the calculator here:  
👉 [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

### How to Use:
1. Select each service you plan to use.
2. Choose the appropriate region (e.g., Southeast Asia or East US).
3. Choose expected usage (e.g., hours per month, storage GB, number of users).
4. Save the estimate or export it to Excel for sharing with stakeholders.

## 📉 Cost Monitoring in Production

Once deployed, use **Azure Cost Management + Billing** to:
- 🔍 Track real-time cost and usage.
- 📆 Set **budgets** and **alerts**.
- 📈 View forecast vs. actual usage.
- 👥 Analyze cost per resource or per department/team.

## 📚 Real-Time Story – Internal Team Support

> **Scenario:**  
Our internal team started building the client website. We first estimated a monthly budget of ~$100 using the Azure Calculator. However, after 1 month in production, our actual cost reached $145.

> **Action Taken:**  
- We reviewed the **Azure Cost Analysis** dashboard.
- Found the App Service was over-provisioned.
- Added an **Azure Budget** alert for $120 to notify the team when nearing the limit.
- Optimized DB performance tier and removed unused staging environments.

> **Result:**  
Our cost reduced to ~$95/month from the next billing cycle.

## 🧩 Best Practices

- 💡 Always **estimate before you deploy**.
- 📍 Use **tags** to track cost per department or project.
- 🕵️‍♀️ Monitor resources with **Azure Advisor** for recommendations.
- 🧪 Use **Dev/Test Pricing** if eligible.
- ⏳ Schedule **Auto-shutdown** for dev/test VMs to save cost.
