# üìò TRUNCATE vs DELETE in SQL Server

Understanding the difference between `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE` in SQL Server is essential for database professionals. Both commands are used to remove data from a table, but they behave very differently in terms of performance, logging, and use cases.

---

## üîç 1. What is DELETE in SQL Server?

* The `DELETE` statement is a **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** command.
* It removes **one or more rows** from a table based on a `WHERE` clause.
* It **logs each deleted row** in the transaction log (fully logged operation).
* Triggers **can be fired** on DELETE.

### ‚úÖ Syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM TableName WHERE condition;
```

## üîç 2. What is TRUNCATE in SQL Server?

* The `TRUNCATE` statement is a **Data Definition Language (DDL)** command.
* It removes **all rows** from a table.
* It **resets the identity column** (if any).
* It is **minimally logged**, making it faster for large tables.
* **Triggers are not fired** on TRUNCATE.

### ‚úÖ Syntax:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE TableName;
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Differences Between DELETE and TRUNCATE

| Feature           | DELETE              | TRUNCATE                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Type              | DML                 | DDL                            |
| Condition support | Yes (can use WHERE) | No (removes all rows)          |
| Logging           | Fully logged        | Minimally logged               |
| Triggers          | Fires triggers      | Does **not** fire triggers     |
| Identity reset    | No                  | Yes                            |
| Rollback possible | Yes                 | Yes                            |
| Speed             | Slower (row-by-row) | Faster (deallocation of pages) |
| WHERE clause      | Allowed             | Not allowed                    |
| Locking           | Row-level locks     | Table and page-level locks     |

## ‚ùì Common Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. **What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE in SQL Server?**

**Answer:**
DELETE is a DML command that can delete specific rows using a WHERE clause, is fully logged, and can activate triggers. TRUNCATE is a DDL command that removes all rows, is minimally logged, resets identity, and doesn‚Äôt activate triggers.

---

### 2. **Can we rollback a TRUNCATE statement?**

**Answer:**
Yes, both TRUNCATE and DELETE can be rolled back if they are used inside a transaction.

```sql
BEGIN TRAN;
TRUNCATE TABLE Products;
ROLLBACK; -- Will undo the TRUNCATE
```

---

### 3. **Can we use a WHERE clause with TRUNCATE?**

**Answer:**
No, TRUNCATE cannot have a WHERE clause. It always removes **all** rows from the table.

---

### 4. **Which is faster: TRUNCATE or DELETE?**

**Answer:**
TRUNCATE is generally faster because it doesn‚Äôt log individual row deletions and uses deallocation of data pages.

---

### 5. **Does TRUNCATE reset identity columns?**

**Answer:**
Yes, it resets identity seed back to the original value defined in the table schema.

---

### 6. **Can TRUNCATE be used on a table with a foreign key constraint?**

**Answer:**
No, you cannot truncate a table that is referenced by a **foreign key constraint**.

---

### 7. **Will TRUNCATE fire triggers defined on the table?**

**Answer:**
No, TRUNCATE does **not** fire triggers, while DELETE does.

---

### 8. **Which command should I use in a production environment?**

**Answer:**
Use `DELETE` when:

* You need to delete specific rows.
* You need to maintain referential integrity.
* You want triggers to execute.

Use `TRUNCATE` when:

* You want to remove all rows quickly.
* No foreign key references exist.
* You don‚Äôt need trigger execution.
