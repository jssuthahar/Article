## ðŸ“Œ Basic Concepts

### ðŸ”¹ WHERE Clause
- Used to filter rows **before** any groupings are made.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';
````

* Used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;
```

* Used to filter groups **after** aggregation.

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) 
FROM Employees 
GROUP BY Department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

## ðŸ§  Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?

**Answer:**

* `WHERE` filters rows **before** grouping.
* `HAVING` filters groups **after** aggregation.
* `WHERE` cannot be used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, etc., but `HAVING` can.

### Q2: Can you use `HAVING` without `GROUP BY`?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can use `HAVING` without `GROUP BY` if you're filtering on aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;
```

---

### Q3: Write a query to find departments having more than 10 employees.

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

---

### Q4: What happens if you use both `WHERE` and `HAVING`?

**Answer:**
The `WHERE` clause filters data **before** itâ€™s grouped.
The `HAVING` clause filters the grouped results.
Example:

```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE Status = 'Active'
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 5000;
```
