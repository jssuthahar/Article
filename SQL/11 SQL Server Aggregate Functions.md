# SQL Server Aggregate Functions ‚Äì Complete Reference

This document explains all **Aggregate Functions** in SQL Server with examples, output, and key interview questions with answers.

## üìò What Are Aggregate Functions?

Aggregate functions perform a **calculation on a set of values** and return a single value. They are commonly used with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses.

## ‚úÖ List of SQL Server Aggregate Functions

| Function     | Description                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `SUM()`      | Returns the total sum of a numeric column     |
| `AVG()`      | Returns the average value                     |
| `MIN()`      | Returns the minimum value                     |
| `MAX()`      | Returns the maximum value                     |
| `COUNT()`    | Returns the count of rows                     |
| `COUNT_BIG()`| Same as `COUNT()` but returns `bigint`        |
| `STDEV()`    | Returns the standard deviation                |
| `STDEVP()`   | Returns the population standard deviation     |
| `VAR()`      | Returns the variance                         |
| `VARP()`     | Returns the population variance               |
| `GROUPING()` | Indicates if a column is aggregated           |
| `CHECKSUM_AGG()` | Returns a checksum of the values         |
| `STRING_AGG()`   | Concatenates values into a string (SQL 2017+) |

## ‚ùì Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is the difference between `COUNT(*)` and `COUNT(column)`?

* `COUNT(*)` counts all rows including NULLs.
* `COUNT(column)` counts only non-NULL values.

---

### Q2: What is the purpose of `STDEV()` and `STDEVP()`?

* `STDEV()` calculates the **sample** standard deviation.
* `STDEVP()` calculates the **population** standard deviation.

---

### Q3: What is the difference between `VAR()` and `VARP()`?

* `VAR()` returns the **sample** variance.
* `VARP()` returns the **population** variance.

---

### Q4: What is `STRING_AGG()` used for?

It concatenates values from a column into a single string, separated by a delimiter. Useful in reporting and grouping text data.

---

### Q5: When to use `COUNT_BIG()`?

Use `COUNT_BIG()` when dealing with **very large datasets**, as it returns `bigint` instead of `int`.

---

### Q6: Can aggregate functions be used in the `WHERE` clause?

No. Use them in the `HAVING` clause after `GROUP BY`.

---

### Q7: What is `CHECKSUM_AGG()` and when is it used?

It returns the checksum of values in a group. Used for **quick data integrity checks** or detecting changes.

## üîö Summary

SQL aggregate functions are crucial for **data analysis**, **reporting**, and **summarizing** large data sets. Familiarity with all these functions is important for both development and interviews.
