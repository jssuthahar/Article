# 📚 Database Design 

## 🛢️ What is Database Design?

- **Database design** is how we **plan and create** the structure of a database.
- It means **deciding which tables** we need, **what columns** (fields) they should have, and **how they are connected**.

**Example:**  
Imagine you are building a shopping app.  
You need tables like:
- **Users** (who are buying)
- **Products** (what they are buying)
- **Orders** (what they ordered)

Good design makes it **easy to find**, **update**, and **protect** data!

## 🔑 What is a Primary Key?

- A **Primary Key** is a **unique ID** for each row (record) in a table.
- It **cannot be NULL** and **must be unique**.

**Think of it like:**  
- Your **Passport Number** or **Student ID** — no two people have the same!

**Example:**
| UserId (Primary Key) | FullName | Email |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | John Doe | john@example.com |
| 2 | Jane Smith | jane@example.com |

➡️ **UserId** is the Primary Key.

## 🔗 What is a Foreign Key?

- A **Foreign Key** is a column that **connects one table to another**.
- It helps **build relationships** between tables.
- It **points to** the **Primary Key** in another table.

**Think of it like:**  
- Your **Library Card** linking you to your **Borrowed Books**.
- One table stores **User info**, another table stores **Books**, and a Foreign Key **connects them**.

**Example:**

| OrderId | UserId (Foreign Key) | OrderDate |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 101 | 1 | 2024-05-01 |
| 102 | 2 | 2024-05-02 |

➡️ **UserId** connects to **Users** table!

## 🎯 Real-Time Example: Small Shopping App

| Table | Primary Key | Example Foreign Keys |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Users | UserId | - |
| Products | ProductId | - |
| Orders | OrderId | UserId (points to Users) |
| OrderItems | OrderItemId | OrderId (points to Orders), ProductId (points to Products) |

**Simple Story:**  
- A user **registers** (Users table).
- They **buy a product** (Products table).
- Their **order is saved** (Orders table).
- Each item inside the order is stored (OrderItems table).

**Without Primary Key and Foreign Key:**
- It would be a big mess.  
- We could not track **who ordered what**.

## 📌 Why do we need this?

| Reason | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| Data Integrity | No missing or wrong links between tables |
| Easy to Manage | Update, delete, find data faster |
| Avoid Duplication | No repeated data everywhere |
| Real Life Mapping | It behaves like real-world systems |

# 🌟 In short:

**Primary Key** = Uniquely identifies a record.  
**Foreign Key** = Creates relationship between records.

**Good database design** = Fast, safe, organized data!

> Always think in real life:  
> **How would you connect people, products, orders?**  
> Database Design is just that — but digitally!
