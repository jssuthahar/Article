# SQL Server: REVOKE and COMMIT Commands

This document provides a clear explanation and usage examples of the `REVOKE` and `COMMIT` commands in SQL Server. These commands are essential for managing security and ensuring data integrity in transactional operations.

---

## üîê REVOKE (Permissions Management)

The `REVOKE` command removes or restricts previously granted permissions from a user or role. It is used to **deny access** to specific SQL Server objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, etc.

### üìå Syntax

```sql
REVOKE permission_type ON object_name TO user_or_role;
````

### ‚úÖ Example

```sql
-- Grant SELECT permission
GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO John;

-- Revoke SELECT permission
REVOKE SELECT ON Employees TO John;
```

### üîé Notes

* `REVOKE` only removes permissions that were previously granted.
* If the permission was **denied** using `DENY`, you need to use `DENY` again to remove that.
* Use `sys.database_permissions` or `fn_my_permissions()` to check current permissions.

## üíæ COMMIT (Transaction Control)

The `COMMIT` command is used to **permanently save** the changes made during a transaction. It ensures that all the operations within a transaction are completed successfully.

### üìå Syntax

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- SQL statements
COMMIT;
```

### ‚úÖ Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance - 1000
WHERE AccountID = 101;

UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance + 1000
WHERE AccountID = 202;

COMMIT;
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Why Use COMMIT?

* To **ensure data integrity**.
* To **group multiple operations** into one atomic unit.
* Used with `ROLLBACK` to undo changes if an error occurs before committing.
