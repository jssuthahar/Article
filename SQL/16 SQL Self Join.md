# SQL Self Join

## üìò What is a Self Join?

A **self join** is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself. It's useful when rows in the same table are related to each other in a hierarchical or relational way.

You typically use **aliases** to differentiate between the two instances of the same table.

## üìä Sample Table: `Employees`

| EmployeeID | Name     | ManagerID |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1          | Alice    | NULL      |
| 2          | Bob      | 1         |
| 3          | Charlie  | 1         |
| 4          | David    | 2         |
| 5          | Eve      | 2         |

---

## üß† Use Case

Find all employees and their managers' names.

---

## üßæ Self Join Query

```sql
SELECT 
    E.Name AS Employee,
    M.Name AS Manager
FROM 
    Employees E
LEFT JOIN 
    Employees M ON E.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID;
````

---

## üîç Explanation

* `E` is the alias for the employee.
* `M` is the alias for the manager.
* We're joining the table `Employees` with itself:

  * `E.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID` matches each employee to their manager.

## üìà Diagram

```plaintext
+-------------+            +-------------+
| Employees E |            | Employees M |
+-------------+            +-------------+
| EmployeeID  |<---------->| ManagerID   |
| Name        |            | Name        |
| ManagerID   |            | EmployeeID  |
+-------------+            +-------------+
```

For example, Bob reports to Alice. So:

* Bob's `ManagerID` is `1`
* Alice's `EmployeeID` is `1`
* The self join matches them.

## ‚úÖ Output of the Query

| Employee | Manager |
| -------- | ------- |
| Alice    | NULL    |
| Bob      | Alice   |
| Charlie  | Alice   |
| David    | Bob     |
| Eve      | Bob     |
