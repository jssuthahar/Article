# SQL Server: ORDER BY and TOP Clauses

## Overview

SQL Server provides powerful tools for sorting and filtering data efficiently using the `ORDER BY` and `TOP` clauses. Understanding these is crucial for writing optimized queries and performing advanced data operations.

---

## üî∏ ORDER BY Clause

### ‚úÖ Purpose
The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns, either in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

### ‚úÖ Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC];
````

### ‚úÖ Example

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

üìå *This will return the list of employees ordered by highest salary first.*

---

## üî∏ TOP Clause

### ‚úÖ Purpose

The `TOP` clause is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.

### ‚úÖ Syntax

```sql
SELECT TOP (N) column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

### ‚úÖ Example

```sql
SELECT TOP (5) FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

üìå *This query returns the top 5 highest paid employees.*

### ‚úÖ With PERCENT

```sql
SELECT TOP (10) PERCENT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

üìå *Returns the top 10% of employees based on salary.*

---

## üî∏ Combining ORDER BY and TOP

To use `TOP` meaningfully, it's essential to combine it with `ORDER BY`. Without `ORDER BY`, the result may be arbitrary and inconsistent.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Wrong: No defined order
SELECT TOP (3) * FROM Employees;

-- Correct: Consistent top 3 based on salary
SELECT TOP (3) * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

## üß† Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. ‚ùì What is the purpose of the ORDER BY clause in SQL Server?

**Answer:** It is used to sort the results of a query based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order.

---

### 2. ‚ùì What is the default sorting order in ORDER BY?

**Answer:** The default sorting order is ascending (`ASC`) if no order is specified.

---

### 3. ‚ùì Can you use ORDER BY on multiple columns?

**Answer:** Yes. You can sort by multiple columns by separating them with commas. Sorting is applied in the specified order.

---

### 4. ‚ùì What does the TOP clause do?

**Answer:** The `TOP` clause limits the number of rows returned by a query.

---

### 5. ‚ùì How does TOP (N) PERCENT differ from TOP (N)?

**Answer:** `TOP (N)` returns the first N rows, while `TOP (N) PERCENT` returns the first N% of the result set.

---

### 6. ‚ùì Why is ORDER BY important when using TOP?

**Answer:** Without `ORDER BY`, the `TOP` clause will return arbitrary rows, as SQL Server does not guarantee row order without explicit sorting.

---

### 7. ‚ùì Can we use ORDER BY in subqueries?

**Answer:** Yes, but with restrictions. ORDER BY in subqueries is allowed when used with `TOP`, `OFFSET-FETCH`, or in combination with a `FOR XML` clause.

---

### 8. ‚ùì Is it possible to use variables with TOP?

**Answer:** Yes. You can pass a variable to the TOP clause using parentheses.

```sql
DECLARE @n INT = 5;
SELECT TOP (@n) * FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

---

### 9. ‚ùì What are alternatives to TOP for pagination?

**Answer:** Use `OFFSET-FETCH` in combination with `ORDER BY` for pagination.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC
OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

---

### 10. ‚ùì What happens if you use ORDER BY on a column not in SELECT list?

**Answer:** SQL Server allows it, as long as the column exists in the table. It's useful for sorting without displaying the sort key.

---

## üõ† Best Practices

* Always use `ORDER BY` with `TOP` to ensure predictable results.
* Use `OFFSET-FETCH` for paging rather than `TOP`.
* Avoid `SELECT TOP (N)` without `ORDER BY`.
* Use column aliases in `ORDER BY` to improve readability.
