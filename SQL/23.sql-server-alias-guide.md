# SQL Server ‚Äì SELECT Column & Table Aliases (Beginner to Expert)

## ‚úÖ Introduction

In **SQL Server**, aliases are temporary names you assign to **columns** or **tables** to make queries **easier to read and understand**.

* **Column Alias:** Renames a column in the result set.
* **Table Alias:** Shortens table names for readability.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Column Alias in SQL Server

### **Basic Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

* `AS` is **optional** in SQL Server.
* Alias exists **only during query execution**.

---

### **Example 1: Simple Column Alias**

```sql
SELECT FirstName AS Name, LastName AS Surname
FROM Employees;
```

**Without `AS` (still valid):**

```sql
SELECT FirstName Name, LastName Surname
FROM Employees;
```

---

### **Example 2: Alias with Spaces**

```sql
SELECT FirstName AS [First Name], Salary AS [Employee Salary]
FROM Employees;
```

> ‚úÖ Use **square brackets `[ ]`** for aliases with spaces or special characters.

---

### **Example 3: Alias with Expressions**

```sql
SELECT Salary * 12 AS [Annual Salary]
FROM Employees;
```

---

### **Example 4: Alias in ORDER BY**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, Salary * 12 AS AnnualSalary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY AnnualSalary DESC;
```

---

### **Important Note**

‚ùå **You cannot use a column alias in the WHERE clause.**

```sql
-- This will fail
SELECT Salary * 12 AS AnnualSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE AnnualSalary > 50000;
```

‚úÖ **Correct way:** Repeat the expression

```sql
SELECT Salary * 12 AS AnnualSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary * 12 > 50000;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Table Alias in SQL Server

### **Basic Syntax**

```sql
SELECT t.column_name
FROM table_name AS t;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName, e.Salary
FROM Employees AS e;
```

‚úÖ **Why use table alias?**

* Makes query **shorter and cleaner**.
* Mandatory in complex queries.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Advanced Column Alias Scenarios

### **With CASE Statement**

```sql
SELECT FirstName,
       CASE
           WHEN Salary > 5000 THEN 'High'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS SalaryCategory
FROM Employees;
```

---

### **With Aggregate Functions**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Total Employees], AVG(Salary) AS [Average Salary]
FROM Employees;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Best Practices for SQL Server

‚úî **Always use meaningful aliases**

```sql
-- Bad:
SELECT FirstName AS X FROM Employees;

-- Good:
SELECT FirstName AS EmployeeName FROM Employees;
```

‚úî **Use brackets for spaces in alias**

```sql
SELECT FirstName AS [Employee Name] FROM Employees;
```

‚úî **Avoid reserved keywords as aliases**

```sql
-- ‚ùå Wrong:
SELECT Salary AS Select FROM Employees;

-- ‚úÖ Correct:
SELECT Salary AS EmployeeSalary FROM Employees;
```

‚úî **Keep aliases short but clear**

```sql
SELECT FirstName AS EmpName FROM Employees;
```

| Feature          | Syntax Example                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Column Alias     | `SELECT column AS alias FROM table;`                |
| Without AS       | `SELECT column alias FROM table;`                   |
| Alias with space | `SELECT column AS [Alias Name] FROM table;`         |
| Expression alias | `SELECT column * 12 AS [Annual Salary] FROM table;` |
| Table Alias      | `SELECT t.column FROM table AS t;`                  |

## ‚úÖ 7. Diagram ‚Äì Where Aliases Apply in SELECT Query

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| SELECT  column_name   AS [Column Alias]                      |
| FROM    table_name    AS [Table Alias]                       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## ‚úÖ 8. Pro Tips for Performance & Readability (SQL Server)

‚úÖ Use **short and descriptive aliases** when working with long column names.
‚úÖ **Always use aliases** when selecting expressions or aggregate functions for clarity.
‚úÖ In reports, use aliases to make column names **user-friendly**.
‚úÖ Avoid ambiguous aliases that **hide the meaning** of the column.
‚úÖ Do **NOT** use aliases in WHERE (SQL Server does not allow it).

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* Column alias = rename output columns.
* Table alias = shorten table names for readability.
* Use `[ ]` for spaces in aliases.
* `AS` is optional but improves readability.
* Cannot use aliases in **WHERE** in SQL Server.
